----------------------------------
Instructions for connecting to vegbank (or beta or tekka) with a Windows machine
to view the contents of the vegbank database on those machines.

----------------------------------
1)Obtaining PostgreSQL ODBC Driver
----------------------------------
You must have a PostgreSQL ODBC driver installed on your machine.  If you know that you do,
proceed to "step 2: Setting up the PostgreSQL Driver"

1a) Downloading the PostgreSQL ODBC driver
    The driver I've used thus far is from the PostgreSQL ODBC project http://odbc.postgresql.org/,
since moved to : http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/psqlodbc/projdisplay.php
    The driver I downloaded from them is at:
    ftp://ftp.us.postgresql.org/odbc/versions/msi/
    titled "psqlodbc-07_02_0005.zip"
    I have made this file available at http://tekka.nceas.ucsb.edu/~lee/odbc/
--->Download this file, a zipped driver, from one of these locations.

1b) Installing the PostgreSQL ODBC driver
--->Unzip the file you downloaded, which will give you the file: psqlodbc.msi
--->Assuming you have the windows installer already installed on your machine, you can double-click
this file to install the postgreSQL driver.  If you have problems installing, or do not have the windows
installer, go the the ftp://ftp.us.postgresql.org/odbc/versions/full/ website to download
drivers with self-extracting installers (as opposed to windows installer)

----------------------------------------
2) Setting up the PostgreSQL ODBC Driver
----------------------------------------
Once the driver is installed, you must set up your computer's ODBC data sources to recognize the driver
and look for the vegbank database over the web.  To do this:
2a) Creating a New ODBC Datasource
--->Open the Control Panel
--->Double-click "Administrative Tools" (if you don't see this, then it is either hidden, which can be corrected
in the start menu properties, or you may not have sufficient priviliges on your machine to modify these settings).
--->Double click "Data Sources (ODCB)"
    You will now see a dialog box that is titled "ODBC Data Source Administrator"
--->Click the "User DSN" tab
--->Click the button to the right "Add..."
    Now you should see a new window titled "Create New Data Source"
--->Scroll down in the window of drivers and select "PostgresSQL" version 7.02.00.05, insight distrinution systems...
   (there may also be "+ (beta)"  and "+ Unicode (beta)" - try one of these if the first one isn't working)
--->Click "Finish"
2b) Setting up the new ODBC connection
    Now you see a new window titled "PostgreSQL ODBS Driver (psqlODBC) Setup
--->Supply a name for the ODBC connection in the "Data Source" box, for example 
    "vegbank" or "vegbank on tekka" (since you may want to connect ot vegbank on tekka, beta, and vegbank machines)
--->You can also add a description of this connection to help you remember exactly what it is
--->Specify the database name to connect to, for us "vegbank" (case-sensitive?)
--->specify the server address, either "vegbank.nceas.ucsb.edu" or "tekka.nceas.ucsb.edu" or "beta.nceas.ucsb.edu"
--->Specify the user name "qa"
--->The password should be blank
--->The port number should be "5432"
--->Press the "SAVE" button.
--->Press the "OK" button on the ODBC window since it should still be open

---------------------------------
3) Linking the tables from Access
---------------------------------
   Here, you can use an extant database or create a new database in access.  You can use a database that 
I developed with a few queries already in it to make browsing taxonomy a bit easier.  It is located:
http://tekka.nceas.ucsb.edu/~lee/odbc/odbc_qrys.zip 
------->MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR ACCESS DATABASE IF IT HAS DATA IN IT THAT ARE VALUABLE<----------
--->Open the MS-Access database that you would like to use as the front-end for the vegbank database
    If there are already tables with vegbank table names in this database, the new vegbank tables from the odbc source will be renamed.
--->Rename any tables that have vegbank table names or delete the tables, or pick a new database
--->Click the File menu | Get External Data | Link Tables
--->In the dialog box, select "Files of Type" as "ODBC()"
    This should open a new dialog box titled "Select Data Source"
--->In the "machine data source" tab, clcik on the name of the ODBC datasource that you created above, as named in step 2b)
--->Press "OK"
    If something doesn't work, now is probably the time.  You may get an error message.  
    The most likely one is that your IP address doesn't match the list of allowed IP addresses.  
    Contact Gabe to have him add your IP address.  You can find out your ip address by going to the windows start menu,
    then "run", then type "cmd", then when you get the black and white DOS screen, type "ipconfig" and press enter. (Type
    "exit" and enter to close the window).
    
    If it worked, you should see a new dialog box that says "Link Tables."  You can eiter select tables
    individually, or, I recommend:
--->Press "select all" and then click "OK"
    It will begin linking the tables.  It may (but shouldn't) ask you to identify field(s) that will identify 
    a unique record.  If this happens, just select something and press OK.  These shouldn't be proper vegbank tables.
    
Now your Access database will have tables that have icons of black arrows next to a globe.  They will
behave just like tables in Access.  You can base forms on them, write reports, make queries, etc.  You
should not be able to edit the data, though.

Good luck!
