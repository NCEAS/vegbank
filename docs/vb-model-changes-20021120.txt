Here is the portion of our minutes from September in which proposed data model changes were discussed.


2-4 Database design and business rule issues 

2-4-1 Intellectual Property and Confidentiality.  
Brad Boyle and Jerry Cooper both pointed out that much plot data needs to remain protected for some years if authors are to agree to post their data.  There followed a discussion of how to resolve this issue.

* The current data model contains the fields "confidentiality_status" and  "confidentiality_reason" within Plot as a mechanisms for handling T&E species and private land issues.
* We need a new permissions layer. Ideally, this would be similar to UNIX permissions.
* The intent is to allow contributors of data to screen potential users for some fixed period of time so as to protect their rights and opportunities to publish based on the data.  However, the same mechanism could be used for other reasons such as rare species or landowner issues.
* The simple version is table of Permissions to see embargoed plots including fields for plot number, party, & permission. Confidentiality status could be maintained within Plot, but perhaps a separate table is need in the event that more than one embargo applies to a particular plot.
* There could be a switch in embargo to allow both observation and plot, but we have not chosen to separate the observations.

Here is the set of two proposed new tables to handle these things
Embargo
Embargo_ID  = PK
Plot_ID = FK to Plot
	Embargo_reason (need new list)
Author stipulation, 
Rare species, 
Landownership, 
Bad data,
Other
	Embargo_start = Date
	Embargo_stop = Date
	Embargo_owner = FK to Party
	Default_Status = Same list as in Permission_Status below
		Permission
Permission_ID = PK
Embargo_ID = FK to Embargo
Party_ID = FK to Party given permission
Permission_Status  (use Confidentiality_Status list)
Public [Default if no embargo]
1 km radius location resolution
10 km radius [Default if landowner or rare species]
100 km radius
Location embargo
Public embargo on data [Default if reason = author]
Full embargo on data
	Permission_Notes

* Business rules.  The embargo owner should be able to lift the embargo for a party or parties via a web form, as should the management team. Submitted plots should be embargoable for up to x (5?) years, and the embargo should be renewed twice. When a plot search reveals one or more embargoed plots, the searcher see only accession # + email of owner
* Subsequent to the meeting we observed that the Storage Resource Broker had aome rather impressive permissions options built in.  Might be a good idea to look these over more carefully.

2-4-2 Individual tree records.
The Enquist (Brad Boyle speaking) and New Zealand (Jerry Cooper & Susan Wiser speaking) groups want individual tree attributes to be contained within the database.  They cite the case of each tree having a voucher (or even multiple vouchers).

Because of the potential existence of multiple vouchers, we agreed to add a table for vouchers.

The essential problem with the current data model is lack of taxonomic determination of individual trees.  Three solutions were discussed.
* (1) Same as currently modeled, but with collection number allowed for each stem record.  This fails if the identification associated with a stem changes and it moves to a different Taxon_Observation because we would then lose the link to old taxon_Interpretations.
* (2) Create a table parallel to Taxon_Observation for individuals, called perhaps Individual_Observation.  The problem here is that we would need a second Individual_Interpretation table, or we would need to place a switch in Taxon_Interpretation so that a record could point to a record in either of the two tables. Similarly, the Voucher table would need a switch so that a record could apply to either the Taxon_Observation or Individual_Observation
* (3) Add an Observation_Type to Taxon_Observation which indicates whether this is an individual stem or a collective record.  If a collective observation, then current fields like cover could be populated, and if an individual observation then a record could be placed in a linked stems table.  This solution has a performance price in that there will be millions of added entries in the table to handle that many individual stems.

We recognized that solution #3 is the best for use in a conceptual data model, while recognizing that the actual physical model implemented may need to be closer to #2 for performance reasons. 

Here is the basic data model (replacing Taxon_Obs, Stem_count and stem_location.
	Biological_Observation (= old Taxon_Observation)
		Biological_Observation_ID = PK
		Observation_ID = FK to the plot 
		Biological_Type (Collective or Individual)
		Cover
		Basal_Area
		Density
		Other collective observation types ??
		Notes
	Stem (replaces current stemCount and stemLocation tables)
		Stem_ID = PK
		Biological_Observation_ID = FK
		Stem_ID = Recursive FK for repeated observations
			(Each set would need a new Observation entry and thus
			A new Biological_Observation_ID record)
		Stem_Diameter
Stem_Diameter_Accuracy
Stem_Height
Stem_Height_Accuracy
		Individual_X_Position
		Individual_Y_Location
		Stem_Code
	Voucher
		Voucher_ID = PK
		Biological_Observation_ID = FK
		Party_ID = collector
		Collection_Number
		Museum
		Accession_Number
		Collection_Date

2-4-3 References
	Need more research.  The following candidate formats were recognized
		ITIS
		EML
		GBIF
		TDWG
BIOSIS
IPNI	

2-4-4 Other changes required
* Change tracking and roll-back capability.  Need to add start and stop dates to various fields.
* Move level & parent to status
* Move table number, page number, line number etc from citation to observation
