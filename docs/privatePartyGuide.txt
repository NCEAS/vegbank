Private Party Guide:

Some parties will be private in vegbank, meaning that their info shouldn't be displayed or exported.

Parties which are created should be, by default, private parties.  Right now, we'd like to use the 
party.PartyType field as "user" to indicate that the party is private.

Once a party has become certified, then their info becomes public and their partyType changes to "person."

Anyone who can make changes or add data to the db should be public.  In cases of plants and comms, the
party may well be "organization" but this isn't a user.  ALL parties that ARE NOT users (has record in usr, logs into vegbank) 
should be public.
