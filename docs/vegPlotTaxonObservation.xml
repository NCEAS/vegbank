	<entityName>vegPlot.TAXONOBSERVATION </entityName>
	<entitySummary>This table stores information about cummulative coverage (coverage accross all strata) of all the taxon recognized within a plot observation.</entitySummary>
	<entityDescription>At the working group meeting at NCEAS in September 2000, it was recognized that this table would store the cummulative coverages of the taxa recognized by the author of the plot.  Also recognized was the importance of maintaining an entity for interpretations of the originak taxa recognized by the plot author, and therefore the entity interpretation was added.</entityDescription>

                              that is needed to define a
                              taxon.  This is like
                              Berendsohn's potential
                              species concept.  Both the

                              as foreign keys to tables in
                              the plants database.
