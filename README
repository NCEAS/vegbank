VegBank is the vegetation plot database of the Ecological Society of America's 
Panel on Vegetation Classification. VegBank consists of three modules that 
contain (1) the actual plot records, (2) vegetation types recognized in the U.S. 
National Vegetation Classification and other vegetation types submitted by users, 
and (3) all plant taxa recognized by ITIS/USDA as well as all other plant taxa 
recorded in plot records. Vegetation records, community types and plant taxa may 
be submitted to VegBank and may be subsequently searched, viewed, annotated, revised, interpreted, downloaded, and cited.

Installation
------------
Vegbank requires
Jakarta-tomcat 4.1, 
PostrgreSQL 7.2, 
Java 1.3
Apache 1.3
Grass
Apache Ant 

VEGBANK JAR FILES
-----------------
The build script creates the vegbank jars and distributes them into the servlet container.
> ant deploy

In addition a number of third party jars are required, these are in the lib directory.


OTHER REQUIRED SERVLET FILES
----------------------------
/vegbank/veg_plot/src/utilities/coord_transform.sh
All the files in the /vegbank/veg_plot/exp/vegbank_websrc/web/WEB-INF/

PROPERTIES FILES:
----------------
./veg_plot/build.properties - edit for your environment. 



DATABASE SETUP:
---------------

Vegbank has a single database for Plots, Plant Taxonomy and Plant 
Community. There is also a Framework database for shared resources like users.


Initializing PostgresSQL:

Install PostgresSQL on the system ... 

# Associate a file with the database ( e.g /home/username/pgdata )
initdb [databasefile]

# Start database ( with debuging output )
postmaster -d2 -i -D databasefile 

# Create the database users as follows:
In an account that has rights to the database ( e.g. postgres )
> createuser  datauser
> createuser [ your unix username ]
> createuser qa

# Build the databases
Some of the sql is auto generated using an ant task.
In the vegclass directory run:
> ant db_rebuild_vegbank

There are finer grained tasks also see ant -projecthelp

# Create framework database
> psql framework < ./veg_plot/sql/create_veguser_tables.sql

# Edit the pg_hba.conf file so that connections may be made to the database 
# add the following:
local      all                                               trust
host       all  127.0.0.1                 255.255.255.255    trust
#host       all  ip of RMI server etc.    255.255.255.255    trust

# GRASS GIS SETUP

This is open source program that is used by vegbank to work with geographic
position data.

Right now it is only used for geocoordinate coversion, it is a large dependancy
just for that.

The programs homepage is "http://www3.baylor.edu/grass/"
