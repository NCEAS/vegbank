Date: 5/19/2006

Pre-requisites:
Java 1.4.2
Ant 1.6.5
Tomcat 5.0
Apache 2.0
mod_jk 1.2.6

Tomcat, Apache and Mod_jk must all be installed and talking to each other.
If you have SELinux turned on, ***make sure you turn it off*** or add appropriate
rules before you attempt to install mod_jk.  If SELinux is running in its
normal configuration, it will not allow mod_jk to create the shared memory
file that it needs for Apache and Tomcat to communicate.

You should have the following environment variables set:
JAVA_HOME
TOMCAT_HOME
