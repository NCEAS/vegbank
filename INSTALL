Pre-requisites:
Java 1.4.2
Ant 1.6.5
Tomcat 5.0
Apache 2.0
mod_jk 1.2.6
Postgresql 8.1.3

Tomcat, Apache and Mod_jk must all be installed and talking to each other.
If you have SELinux turned on, ***make sure you turn it off*** or add appropriate
rules before you attempt to install mod_jk.  If SELinux is running in its
normal configuration, it will not allow mod_jk to create the shared memory
file that it needs for Apache and Tomcat to communicate.

You should have the following environment variables set:
JAVA_HOME
TOMCAT_HOME
ANT_HOME

INSTALLING TOMCAT, ANT, APACHE AND MOD_JK
=========================================
NOTE: Tomcat, Apache and Mod_jk must all be installed and talking to each other.
If you have SELinux turned on, ***make sure you turn it off*** or add appropriate
rules before you attempt to install mod_jk.  If SELinux is running in its
normal configuration, it will not allow mod_jk to create the shared memory
file that it needs for Apache and Tomcat to communicate.

1) Tomcat: download (jakarta.apache.org) and unpack the 
jakarta-tomcat-5.0.x.tar.gz file to the 
directory where you want tomcat installed.  Unpack the archive.  Create a 
symlink to jakarta-tomcat in the same directory.  This is useful if you 
upgrade tomcat later so you won't have to update all your config files.  
To do this enter this command:
bash$ ln -s jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28 jakarta-tomcat
You should get a link like this:
lrwxrwxrwx  1 berkley berkley  21 May 23 13:57 jakarta-tomcat -> jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28
Next, edit the jakarta-tomcat/conf/server.xml file and make sure that the 
Connector for AJP13 is enabled and running on port 8009.  It should look like:
<Connector port="8009"
               enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" debug="0"
               protocol="AJP/1.3" />
and it should be uncommented. At this point, also make any other necessary
changes to the server.xml file.  If you don't want a tomcat-standalone
running on port 8080, you can comment that connector out.  Sometimes it's 
useful for testing though.

2) Ant: Vegbank uses the Ant build system for installation.  You will need
ant installed and on your path.  Download (jakarta.apache.org/ant) and
unpack the ant archive.  It's usually good to install it into the same
directory where you put tomcat.  It should unpack into a single directory.
You will need your JAVA_HOME env. variable set to your java installation.
If you want to make things easier on yourself, DO NOT use a java installation
that came with an OS distro!  Download and install a real version of Java from
java.sun.com instead.  Your env. vars should look something like this:
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_10
ANT_HOME=/usr/local/devtools/apache-ant-1.6.5
now add java and ant to your path like this:
bash$ export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin
if you do an 'env |grep PATH' you should get something like this:
PATH=/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:
/home/berkley/bin:/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_10/bin:/usr/local/devtools/apache-ant-1.6.5/bin

you should now be able to type 'java -version' and get 
[berkley@aldo vegbank]$ java -version
java version "1.4.2_10"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_10-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_10-b03, mixed mode)
and type 'ant' and get 
[berkley@aldo vegbank]$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
Build failed

If you get those two, you're golden.

3) Install apache.  I'm not going to talk you through this.  there are plenty
of tutorials on the web.

4) Install mod_jk.  This can be a pain.  If you can get a distro that has
apache and mod_jk co-compiled or co-installed that's the easiest.  

5) Configure apache/tomcat/mod_jk.  Make sure you've done the enabling the 
8009 connector in step 1 above.  Then go to your /etc/httpd/conf directory
(you'll need root access) and edit httpd.conf.  Make sure that there is a line 
that says:
Include conf.d/*.conf
next, go to the bottom of that file and add the following:
<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName aldo.nceas.ucsb.edu
  ServerAlias vegbank-test.nceas.ucsb.edu
  ServerAdmin root@server.com
  DocumentRoot /usr/www/vegbank/htdocs
  ErrorLog /usr/www/vegbank/logs/error_log
  CustomLog /usr/www/vegbank/logs/access_log commong
  <Directory "/usr/www/vegbank/htdocs/">
    Options FollowSymLinks Indexes
    AllowOverride all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
Change the values to match your server config.  The important thing here
is that we are changing the <Directory> attributes for /usr/www/vegbank/htdocs
This is very important.  

Save the httpd.conf file and create (or edit) a file in the same directory
called workers.properties.  Make it look like this:

workers.tomcat_home=/usr/local/devtools/jakarta-tomcat
workers.java_home=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_10
ps=/
worker.list=ajp13
worker.ajp13.port=8009
worker.ajp13.host=localhost
worker.ajp13.type=ajp13

This defines the worker for our ajp connection. Now we need to tell mod_jk
to use this worker.  edit the file /etc/httpd/conf.d/mod_jk.conf.
It should be made to look like this:

LoadModule      jk_module modules/mod_jk.so
JkWorkersFile   /etc/httpd/conf/workers.properties
JkLogFile       logs/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel      debug
JkMount /vegbank ajp13
JkMount /vegbank/* ajp13
<Location "/WEB-INF/">
    AllowOverride None
    deny from all
</Location>

This tells mod_jk to mount the server directory /vegbank and route it to 
tomcat for processing instead of just serving it statically.  It also 
prevents people from listing the contents of your WEB-INF directory.  

That should be it.  Now we can get the database and Vegbank itself installed.

=======================
INSTALLING THE DATABASE
=======================
Vegbank requires Postgresql to be installed and configured on the server.  It
is recommended that it be version 8.1.3 or later, though we have tested with 
8.1.3 and 7.4.8.

After you have installed postgres, you will need to setup a database and 
user for the vegbank tablespace.  Note that if you are starting from a 
blank database, you must do these commands as the 'postgres' user with the
postmaster running.
create the database
bash$ createdb -E UNICODE vegbank
create a user for the db
note that depending on what postgres user system you are using, this may
require you to create a system user account for 'vegbank' as well
bash$ createuser vegbank
login to postgres and give the user privileges on the new database
bash$ psql vegbank
psql=> grant all on database vegbank to vegbank;
GRANT
psql=> \q
you should now be able to login to the new database like this
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank
vegbank=>

Initializing the database with a vegbank backup file
----------------------------------------------------
Now you just have to create the database schema that vegbank will use.
If you have a postgresql backup dump that you are installing the db from, 
use the command:
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank < backupFile.sql > dbimport.log 2>&1
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank < build/sql/create_aggregrates.sql
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank < build/sql/create_extras.sql
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank < build/sql/createIndices.sql
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank < build/sql/create_vegbank_views.sql
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank < build/sql/vegbank_populate_configtables.sql
bash$ psql -U vegbank vegbank < build/sql/create_vegbank_views.sql

The create views is listed twice in case there are conflicts with config tables.
Some of the above SQL may also be run already in the backup file.  
But these files are such that running them multiple times shouldn't create errors.



IF YOUR VERSION IS LESS THAN THE CURRENT VERSION, you should run scripts
in vegbank/bin titled like upgradeTo[version#].sh

>>MAKE SURE build.properties is set properly for the database name you want<<

To find out the version of your database, check in the table: dba_datamodelversion.
All versions since 1.0.5 and their initial date should be listed here.

Run all version numbers greater than the version of your database to the version
you want.

For example, if the backup version was 1.0.5, and the current version was 1.0.7, 
you'd :
bash$ cd ~/vegbank
bash$ upgradeTo1.0.6.sh
bash$ upgradeTo1.0.7.sh

At the time of this writing, only upgradeTo1.0.5.sh exists, and that should be run
on any database backup from roughly August 2005 until September 2006 if the database
doesn't identify itself as version 1.0.5

There will be errors in the SQL, because the script isn't sure what needs to be dropped,
so it drops things or tries to create views that may fail.  It repeats the attempts 
as needed to make it work.  The dbVerify target is run at the end of the upgrade scripts
(it will fail for the first one if you are running more than one).


Initializing a clean database installation (no data)
----------------------------------------------------
bash$ ant createdb


You won't have to update the version numbers in this scenario.

You should then be able to login and use the \d command in psql to display
the table structure of the database

And admin user (username: admin@vegbank.org, password: vbadmin) will be created
automatically and can be used to create other accounts.  It is highly recommended
that you change the admin password via the change password facility in vegbank
as soon as possible after installation.  Note the passwords are stored in the
usr table and are digested to prevent snooping.

==============================
INSTALLING THE WEB APPLICATION
==============================

Before you begin the actual install, you'll need to make sure some directories
are setup.  
Vegbank home directory:    /usr/vegbank
                           /usr/vegbank/upload
                           /usr/vegbank/export
                           /usr/vegbank/data
                           /usr/vegbank/logs
Vegbank static web root:   /usr/www/vegbank
                           /usr/www/vegbank/htdocs
                           /usr/www/vegbank/logs
These directories should all be writable by the user who installs vegbank, the
user that is going to run tomcat and by the 'apache' user.  
To make it easier, you can create a new group, change 
the permissions to g+rwx (with group ownership of your new group
and add the relevant users to that group.  
Here's an example where 'berkley' is the installation user and 'dev' is the 
group to which 'apache', 'tomcat' and 'berkley' all belong.  This is a listing
of the contents of /usr/vegbank:
drwxrwxr-x  2 berkley dev 4096 May 23 14:12 data
drwxrwxr-x  2 berkley dev 4096 May 23 14:12 export
drwxrwxr-x  2 berkley dev 4096 May 23 14:12 logs
drwxrwxr-x  2 berkley dev 4096 May 23 14:12 upload
[berkley@aldo vegbank]$

bash$ ant install
start tomcat and apache then (always start tomcat first):
bash$ ant web-install

to clean the build
------------------
bash$ ant clean
or to clean the build and clean the install use:
bash$ ant full-clean
