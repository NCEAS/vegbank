taxaData/plantlst1996.bin.gz
taxaData/plantlst2000.bin.gz -- these 2 files
 are the USDA-PLANTS data downloaded from their 
 website (2000 and 1996 was from Bob Peet) with 
 minor formatting changes including: 

	removed the funny 'x' like charaters from the 2000 data list
	and removed the ' X ' in the 1996 data -- replacing both with
	an 'x' then the species name.  Also removed the '&' and substituted
	with the phrase 'and' lastly I added a space ' ' that replaced the
	single quote ''' that kept messing up the sql code embedded in the
	java code  -- put both these files into filenames :
