 * This DTD describes the structure and content of XML files that are used to
 * store NVC community data, and is consistent with the concept-based community 
 * database designed by Peet and Taswell.  Because said datamodel changes almost
 * daily, this dtd will also change, possibly dramatically in the near future
 *
 * Still trying to has out the descrepency over how to connect a concept with a
 * name in the dtd file.  Because the name and concept will probably always be 
 * used together in an xml file just keep them together in the dtd file
