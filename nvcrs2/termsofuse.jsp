To upload material to NVCRS the submitter must confirm 
possession of the right to distribute the submitted material 
and must either convey that right to the Ecological Society of America 
in the form of transfer of copyright or confirm that ESA holds that right 
owing to the information being in the public domain or being available 
through the fair-use provisions of US copyright law. <br><br>


Data downloaded from NVCRS and used in some subsequent work must be identified in that 
work by reference to NVCRS accession number(s) and the date(s) of the download.<br>

NVCRS is managed by the Vegetation Panel of the Ecological Society of America as a 
public service. It is the intent of ESA to work with partner organizations to assure 
the long-term availability of data deposited in NVCRS so as to allow citation of the information 
in scholarly works and other derivative products. Nonetheless, in so doing ESA makes no guarantees 
as to the long-term maintenance or availability of information deposited in NVCRS. 
In addition ESA provides no warrantee or guarantee as to the accurateness or completeness 
of the information in NVCRS.<br><br>

ESA reserves the right to reject submissions that appear not to meet standards for submission published 
in the Vegetation Panel standards document. The primary check will be a software filter applied at time 
of submission, but subsequent review by management staff may also lead to rejection. 
The submitter will be notified by email if a submission is latter rejected. <br>
