VegBank -- Apache 1.3 Special Setup
===============================================================

VegBank makes minor adjustments to the Apache config file,
which is usually found at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.

VegBank uses an .htaccess file with RewriteRule directives, so
Apache needs to allow the FileInfo override in the directory
where VegBank lives.  Choose one of the following configuration
types for your system, either document root or virtual host.

>>> MAIN DOCUMENT ROOT
If your VegBank web files are part of the main document root,
find the <Directory "/your/document/root"> section and add
or change the AllowOverride directive to look like this:


	<Directory "/var/www/html">

	# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can
	# override. Can also be "All", or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo",
	# "AuthConfig", and "Limit"
	#
	    #AllowOverride None
	    AllowOverride FileInfo

	</Directory>



>>> VIRTUAL HOST
If your VegBank web files are part of the main document root,
find the <VirtualHost> section for the site and add the following:

	<Directory "/absolute/path/to/directory/called/plot">
	    AllowOverride FileInfo
	</Directory>
