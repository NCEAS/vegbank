To allow the use of the tomcat manager application the tomcat-user.xml needs to
be edited and placed into $TOMCAT_HOME/conf

Working with Apache
1) Install mod_jk
2) Add the following to the end of httpd.conf
  <IfDefine HAVE_JK>
  LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so
  AddModule  mod_jk.c
  Include /etc/httpd/conf/mod_jk.conf
  </IfDefine>
3) Put the mod_jk.conf file and the workers.properties files into
/etc/httpd/conf directory.


NOTE: The mod_jk.conf must be edited if a new context is added.
