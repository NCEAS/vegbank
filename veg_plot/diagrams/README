- servletDesign.vsd:
	This document shows the methods included in the various classes
	embodying the web-based "plotQuery" module.  The servlet classes are
	enveloped in the maroon box, the html pages are in the blue box and the
	utilities are in the black-dashed box.  Basically a session is started
	when the login page is requested by a user through the browser.  The
	user then enters the user and password into the html form which is
	passed to the 'authenticate' class -- which if validated will put a
	cookie into the browser.  With this cookie-based authentication the user
	may successfully request other pages (including the plotQuery, fileDownload
	and eventually the fileupload pages).  In the natural progression the
	user will request the plotQuery html page and fill out a form whose
	input attributes will be passed to the 'plotQuery' servlet where an xml
	document is composed and output.  This xml file contains information
	that is then passed to the "plotAccess" module where the database queries
	are made.  Results from the query are returned as an xml file from the
	"plotAccess" module which can either be viewed/analyzed using the
	'viewData' servlet or downloaded via the 'filedownload' servlet.
	
	It is important to notice that all the database operations (including
	querying, updating and insertion) take place from within the
	"plotAccess" module whereas the "plotQuery" module (comprised of the
	servlets) is used for composing the xml query documents,
	viewing/analyzing the data returned from the queries, formatting the
	data for download etc.
	
	
- servletArchitecture.vsd:

	This image is similar to the servletDesign.vsd with the exception: that 
	this diagram does not include the methods of the various classes and
	that the classes shown are only the main servlet classes, ie. no utility
	classes.
