<p><b>plot_id</b> - System assigned unique identifier for each individual
plot.&nbsp; At this time a vegetation plot is defined by both discrete
location (a single point) and date; meaning that two plots may exist for
a single location if the supporting data were collected at differing times.&nbsp;
Also, sub-plots having smaller lateral coverage may exist within a larger
regional plot.
<p><b>party_id </b>- System assigned unique identifier for each party.
<p><b>roleCode</b> - described in ISO 19115.3 (contact person, author,
PI)
