Vegetation Plots Database - <i>working draft 7/30/2000</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>plot_master</u></b>
<p><b>plot_id</b> - System assigned unique identifier for each individual
plot.&nbsp; At this time a vegetation plot is defined by both discrete
location (a single point) and date; meaning that two plots may exist for
a single location if the supporting data were collected at differing times.&nbsp;
Also, sub-plots having smaller lateral coverage may exist within a larger
regional plot.
<p><b>author_plot_number</b> - this is the author's plot description number
used in a publication to refer to this plot
<p><b>previous_plot_record</b> - if the plot represents a re-measurement
provide the original plot_id, this is self-referential and it should be
a foreign key to plot_id
<p><b>date</b> - day/month/year the plot was described
<p><b>date_accuracy</b> - plus/minus number of days
<p><b>landOwner</b> - owner of the land on which the plot was sampled
<p><b>samplingMethod</b> - method used for plot sampling (including, but
not limited to: Daubenmire, modified Daubenmire, Zuric-Montpellier, North
Carolina Vegetation Survey and TNC
<p><b>effort_level</b> - the effort spent describing the plot (very thorough,
average effort, hurried)
<p><b>vegUniformity</b> - a measure of the small scale heterogeneity (see
the Damman document)
<p><b>element_cover</b> - percent cover of element
<p><b>class_association</b> - name or code of association to which the
plot belongs.&nbsp; This will probably not be included because it is interpretive
and thus does not belong here
<p><b>class_alliance</b>&nbsp; - name or code of alliance to which the
plot belongs.&nbsp; This will probably not be included because it is interpretive
and thus does not belong here
<p><b>classification_quality</b> - with what degree of confidence could
the plot record be assigned to a recognized association.&nbsp; Again, this
is based on an interpretation
