<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>strata_composition</u></b> (possible change table name to species_vert_structure)
<p><b>plot_id</b> - System assigned unique identifier for each individual
plot.&nbsp; At this time a vegetation plot is defined by both discrete
location (a single point) and date; meaning that two plots may exist for
a single location if the supporting data were collected at differing times.&nbsp;
Also, sub-plots having smaller lateral coverage may exist within a larger
regional plot.
<p><b>species_original </b>- name of a plant species as it was named in
the plot collection
<p><b>stratum_type </b>- stratum level (moss, herb, bush, tree, etc.)
<p><b>percent_coverage</b> - this is the coverage of the named species
within a stratum
