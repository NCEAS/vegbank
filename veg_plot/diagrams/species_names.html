Vegetation Plots Database - <i>working draft 7/30/2000</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>species_names</u></b>
<p><b>plot_id</b> - System assigned unique identifier for each individual
plot.&nbsp; At this time a vegetation plot is defined by both discrete
location (a single point) and date; meaning that two plots may exist for
a single location if the supporting data were collected at differing times.&nbsp;
Also, sub-plots having smaller lateral coverage may exist within a larger
regional plot.
<p><b>species_original </b>- name of a plant species as it was named in
the plot collection
<p><b>species_current </b>- this is either the plant name or the operational
taxonomic unit (OTU)
<p><b>cum_strata_coverage </b>- for species occurring in more than one
stratum, the cover in all strata combined, i.e.. the total coverage of
that species in the plot
