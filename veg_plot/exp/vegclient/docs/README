-- THESE ARE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOADING A SIMPLE
-- DATA SET, IN THE FUTURE MORE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION
-- WILL BE DISTRIBUTED WITH THE SOFTWARE


After installing the software using the vegclient installer:

1] go to the installation directory and start the the application
   by clicking the vegclient.exe (or running the vegclient.sh on a 
   unix machine)

2] once the main frame appears, select the 'utilities' tab and then the 
   'Database tools' choice which will pop up a second window.

3] on the second window called 'DatabaseManagerInterface' select the 'Database Startup'
   tab and mash the 'start' button

4] then choose the 'Database Tables' subpane and with the hit the 'run' button on the 
   'Create Summary Tables' -- this creates the database

5] go back to the main frame and and choose the 'Data Load' option and then the 'Upload Plot
   Data - new' option.

6] hit the 'Select Project' button and navigate to the 'data/native' sub-directory and choose 
   the 'peet_project.xml' file.  The frame may hang for a sec while the file is loaded to memory
   but then will populate the left TextArea.

7] choose the plots that should be loaded to the database by clicking on the plot names
   or the whole project can be loaded by selecting the 'Select Entire Project' radio button
	 at the bottom of the frame.  

8] load the local database by mashing the 'Load Local DB' button

9] the data may be uploaded to the central server too by hitting the 'Upload Central DB'
   button -- at this point the data are stored on the central server and are not actually 
	 loaded to the central database

10] now that the data are loaded into the local database the database 'views' must be generated,
    in the future this will be done automatically, but at this point the user must do this explicitly
		by going to the 'Utilities' on the main frame and choose the 'database tools' and then go to the 
		'Database Tables' sub-panel and hit the 'Create Summary Tables' button -- this may take a while
		depending on the number of plots loaded to the database.

11] now that there are data in the loacal database the data may be queried by going to the main window 
   and choose 'Extended Veg Database Query' from the 'Data Query' menu.  Try a query where the

	 Query Criteria='Plot Code'
	 Query Operator='like'
	 Query Token='%'

	 make sure to have the 'Local Database' radio button selected at the top of the frame

	 hit the 'Append Query' button once to register the query with the database (multiple 
	 queries can be appended in order to develop a nested query) then issue the query by 
	 hitting the 'Issue Query' button.  

12] If there is a valid result set, a window should pop-up asking the user to select the attributes
   that should be viewed in the summary viewer.  Choose the attributes that are desired and then hit 
	 the view data and a summary of the selected data should be displayed.

13] close the program by closing the main window.
