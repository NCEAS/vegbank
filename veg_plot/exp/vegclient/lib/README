xmloperator.jar -- the library that includes an xml editor
xalan.jar -- the processor that came with the xmloperator (probably newer than xalan_1_2_2.jar)
xerces_1_4.jar -- the parser that came with the xmloperator and is newer than the one that I was
	using
xalan_merge.jar -- the results of unjarring the 2 xalan jar files then re-archiving them so that my 
	code will work with the xml operator code.
