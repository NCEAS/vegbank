  ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDE FOR ADMINISTRATING VEGBANK
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------

If you are trying to troubleshoot, see ERROR_CORRECTION instead!

This guide describes how various things in the system work that 
require administrative intervention.


----------------------------------------------------------
1) CERTIFICATION
----------------------------------------------------------
Certification is the process by which users gain additional 
privileges so that they may access higher functionality,
e.g., loading plot data, interpreting a plant, interpreting a
plot, loading plants and communities, adding notes, etc.

**Certification Scheme*************
A user's certification level is based on their usr.permission_level
field value.  This is a numeric field that is a combination (sum) of
the following levels:
 1: registered
 2: certified
 4: professional
 8: admin
 
 A user with all permission levels will have a value of 15 (1+2+4+8)
 
Currently, professional permission doesn't give you access to anything
in particular.  That may be reserved for future function such as 
marking two plots as synonyms.

**Requesting Certification**********
A registered user requests certification at:
http://vegbank.org/vegbank/LoadCertification.do

Once a user fills this out, it sends email to 
panel@vegbank.org (see later documentation on email lists).

The Panel should review the application and once a decision has been
made, the link from the email should be followed that looks like this:
 http://vegbank.org/vegbank/ViewCertification.do?certId=[someNumber]
 (you must be logged in as an admin to do this)
 
There is currently no mechanism to bug the panel list to respond to 
the certification requests other than this email queue.  So it is
IMPORTANT NOT TO FORGET ABOUT THESE FOLKS!

Once a user has been certified, you can adjust their permissions by
selecting "Admin Menu" from homepage (again, while logged in as admin)
Then "View/Edit Users" which takes you here:
http://vegbank.org/vegbank/ListUsers.do
This lists all VegBank users and their permission levels.  Click the 
permission level to adjust their permissions in a new form.

NOTE THAT USERS SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE REGISTERED LEVEL.
AND THAT PROFESSIONAL USERS DO NOT BY DEFAULT ALSO HAVE THE CERTIFIED
LEVEL.




----------------------------------------------------------
2)  EMAIL LISTS
----------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of email lists associated with VegBank.
These are all administered through ecoinformatics.org.

help@vegbank.org : Users send email here when they need
help with the website/system.  Gets sent to developers.  

dba@vegbank.org : Users send email here when they need
help with their data loads, requests for data, etc.
Gets sent to developers.

users@vegbank.org: The public users mailing list.  Users
can post messages to this forum and admins/developers
can respond, as can other users.

vegbranch@vegbank.org: The public VegBranch mailing list. 
Similar to users list, but covers topics about VegBranch
instead of VegBank.

panel@vegbank.org: The certification panel for VegBank 
certification requests.

vegbank-cvs : This is the cvs commit mailing list for 
VegBank developers.

I think there is one additional list, but I can't recall
what it is now.
