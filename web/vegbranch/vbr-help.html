This page describes VegBranch's help section.  Almost every button, field, picklist, panel, etc. is
described locally in VegBranch.  <span class="category">You should right-click on something in VegBranch that you don't
understand, and select "Help"</span> from the menu of options there.  This takes you to a description of the form
and the item you right-clicked on.  From that screen, there is also a link to online help that is in not completely finished.  </p>
