<p>
This page describes VegBranch's help section.  Almost every button, field, picklist, panel, etc. is 
described locally in VegBranch.  You should right-click on something in VegBranch that you don't 
understand, and select "Help" from the menu of options there.  This takes you to a description of the form 
and the item you right-clicked on.  From that screen, there is also a link to online video demonstrations
of how to use VegBranch.  </p>
<p>
If you are still having trouble, or help hasn't been finished for a form that you would like help with, please email us at help@vegbank.org.  
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to step through all the video demos, please <a href="@vegbranch_demo_link@vegbranch_download.html">CLICK HERE TO START VEGBRANCH DEMONSTRATIONS.</a>  Note that you will need a flash-enabled browser to see the videos.
