<p>
This form links you to all the functionality you'll need to enter data
manually into forms that are similar to those found in NPS-PLOTS.
You may not need to press all the buttons on this form.  But if you follow
the buttons in order, you should be able to enter your data simply,
then export to a NPS-PLOTS database, and move your data into VegBank, too.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>0. 
      Erase VegBranch Loading Tables</strong> -- Press this button to erase any data already in the loading module
      of VegBranch.  This is necessary if you have entered or imported data 
      into the loading module previously. 
  </li>    
  <li><strong>1. <a href="Help.form.cust_entry_nps2_buildusdalist.html">
      Create USDA-PLANTS list</a></strong> -- 
      VegBranch needs to create a simplified USDA list from the complex 
      version in the VegBank Module.  Press this button to select 
      options to create one.
  </li>
  <li><strong>2. <a href="Help.form.cust_entry_nps2_project.html">
      Specify Project Metadata</a></strong> -- 
      This takes you to a form where you can specify metadata that 
      applies to all data you will subsequently enter.
  </li>
  <li><strong>3. <a href="Help.form.cust_entry_nps2_plots.html">
      Enter PLOTS data into forms</a></strong> -- 
      Press this button to enter plots data and species occurring on each plot.  
      The plot type selecting in Project Metadata will be used 
      (normal, quick plots, AA Observations).  From this form, you will
      be able to link to other forms for entering the species on a plot.
  </li>
  <li><strong>4. 
      (optional) Export plots to separate NPS-PLOTS database</strong> -- 
      Once you have completed data entry for all plots, 
      and you would like to export the data into a separate, 
      stand-alone database, press this button.  A new database will be 
      created in the same folder as VegBranch.  A window will tell you 
      where the file is located (but you can move or rename the NPS-PLOTS database
      after VegBranch creates it).
  </li>
  <li><strong>5. Move data into VegBranch tables</strong> -- 
        After you have finished data entry, press this button to move all 
        your data into the Loading Module tables of VegBranch.  This does quite 
        a bit of work to reformat your data into the VegBranch format.
        If you already have data in the VegBranch loading tables, you'll
        be asked to confirm that you want to add this data, or replace the
        old data with your plots.
  </li>
  <li><strong>6. Move data into VegBranch tables</strong> -- 
        After moving your data into loading module tables, press this button 
        to continue VegBranch migration.  VegBranch will automatically 
        translate data and check for errors.  You'll need to fix any errors 
        and translate any unmatched plants, communities, lists.
        If you need help with the translation or data checking forms 
        that you'll be taken to, press the HELP button in VegBranch
        from those forms.
        
  </li>
  <li><strong>7. Erase initial NPS-PLOTS data</strong> -- 
        After you have finished MIGRATION to the VegBank Module and loaded 
        your data into VegBank, you can remove the plots in the NPS-PLOTS 
        entry tables in VegBranch.  Does NOT erase exported tables to a new 
        database.  
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Other forms you will encounter along the way: <br/>
 <a href="Help.form.cust_entry_nps2_plots-species_master.html">View/Edit Species List</a><br/>
 <a href="Help.form.cust_entry_nps_chooseplant.html">Choose a Plant</a><br/>
 
 
 <p>That's all there is to the process of entering data in NPS-PLOTS forms
 and moving it into VegBank.</p>
