This form allows you to choose which plant you would like to use on the previous form.  
Enter some part of the plant name in the box at the top and press "search" to 
limit the list of plants shown.  Click the plant and press "OK" when you've found 
the right plant.
</p>
<p><strong>Searching</strong>: Fill in the beginning of the plant name, for example:
"Acer" to search for all maples.  You can use * as a wildcard.  So "*rubra*" searches
for anything that has the letters "rubra" in the name. </p>
<p><strong>Enter Key</strong>: When you are filling in letters in the search box,
you can press the Enter Key on your keyboard after you've entered the letters.
If you select a plant, you can then press enter, which will press the "OK" button for you.
</p>
<p><strong>I can't find my plant</strong>: If you've searched and can't find a matching
plant, consider these issues.</p>
<ul><li>Is there an alternate spelling possible?  Try using a wildcard in place 
of letters that might be spelled differently in USDA Plants.  You can <a href="@forms_link@PlantQuery.jsp">search VegBank</a>
for a different spelling, or also <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">
search the USDA Plants website</a>.</li>
    <li>Did I delete plants from my VegBank Module that may have included this plant?
    VegBranch has a form that allows you to delete plants that, according to USDA,
    do not occur in states you select.  It's possible you deleted this plant.  If
    so, you can either search for the plant in VegBank (see the above link), and
    download it into your VegBank Module, or you could download a fresh VegBank
    Module from the <a href="@vegbranch_link@vegbranch.html">VegBranch page</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Is your plant a "sp."?  If you are looking for a plant name with a "sp." attached to it,
    you won't find such a name in the USDA list.  You should choose the Genus instead (or family)
    and press the "sp." button on the 
    <a href="Help.form.cust_entry_nps2_plots-species_master.html">plot-species form.</a></li>
    <li>If this really is a new plant, you can exit this form (without selecting anything)
    and enter the name of the plant in the previous form, in the Scientific Name
    field.  Then, after moving data into the VegBranch tables, you can add a new 
    plant, using the "Species List" loading table.  See the 
    <a href="@vegbranch_link@vbr-loadmod.html">Loading Module Documentation</a>
    for more on how to do this.
    </li>
