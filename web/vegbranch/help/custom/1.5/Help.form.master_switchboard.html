<h2>Help for 'Load Data<!-- [master_switchboard]-->'</h2>
<img border="0" alt="in progress: (screen shot of 'Load Data')" src="../screenshots/smaller/master_switchboard_1.4.png">
<p>
<help>This form takes data from a digital format (spreadsheet file, the generic .csv or comma-separated values; or Access database) and imports these data into one of the loading tables in VegBranch.<br>
        
<br>First select which table you'd like to import to, then find the file and import it.  If field names do not match, you'll be directed to a new form where you can map your field names onto VegBranch loading table field names.  If your file is a matrix file, it can be normalized using a button that links to a utility in vegbranch that normalizes this file.</help>
