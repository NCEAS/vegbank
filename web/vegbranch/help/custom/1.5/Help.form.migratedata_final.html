<h2>Help for 'Migrate Data<!-- [migratedata_final]-->'</h2>
<img border="0" alt="in progress: (screen shot of 'Migrate Data')" src="../screenshots/smaller/migratedata_final_1.2.png">
<p>
<help>This form takes the data in the loading module and migrates (copies) it to the vegbank module, which is the connected database that mimics the vegbank.org database.  You should only use this form after you have used the data check form to determine that there are no errors in your data that will prevent migration from occurring smoothly.  Also, it is recommended that you use the "backup vegbank module" button to make a backup copy of that database in the event of errors.</help>
