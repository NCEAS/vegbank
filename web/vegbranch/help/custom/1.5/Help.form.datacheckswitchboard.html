<h2>Help for 'Data Check<!-- [datacheckswitchboard]-->'</h2>

<p>
<help>The Data Checking form analyzes your data and shows you errors that will prevent migration of your data to VegBank format.  If you attempt to migrate data with errors, the migration will be interrupted by error messages.<br>Generally, the data checking looks to see if your data are consistent with each other and if you have overlooked a step in the loading process.<br>
        
<br>Errors of many different types are checked.  One row will appear for each error that is found.  If a certain type of error is not found, the row for that error will not appear at all.  The total number of errors of all types is displayed in red at the top of the form.</help>
