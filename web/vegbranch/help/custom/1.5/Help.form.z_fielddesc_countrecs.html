<help>The data dictionary shows field information and the actual data in those fields for a table that you choose.  This is useful for understanding the structure of the loading module and the vegbank module.  You can see what fields are in a table, as well as what limitations there are on each field, such as data type (number, text, or date) and closed lists which apply to a field (limited values are acceptable).</help>
