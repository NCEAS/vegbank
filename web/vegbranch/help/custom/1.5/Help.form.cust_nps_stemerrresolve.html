<h2>Help for 'custom NPS conversion in VegBranch: unparsable text in [plots-species].[DBH] field<!-- [cust_nps_stemerrresolve]-->'</h2>

<p>
<help>This form shows you errors that VegBranch encountered when trying to copy stems from the DBH comma-separated list into the VegBranch stems tables, where each stem is listed separately as one DBH value.  Errors are from a DBH field value in the NPS-PLOTS data that aren't true comma-separated values.  There is usually just some extra text that is useful to a person, but confusing to a computer.</help>
