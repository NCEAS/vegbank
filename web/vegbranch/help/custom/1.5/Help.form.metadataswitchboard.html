<h2>Help for 'Metadata<!-- [metadataswitchboard]-->'</h2>
<img border="0" alt="in progress: (screen shot of 'Metadata')" src="../screenshots/smaller/metadataswitchboard_1.4.png">
<p>
<help>Here, you may supply data that may not already be in the rest of your data files.  Any values you specify here will be used if there is no value in the rest of your data.  If, for example, you specify a cover method in your Plot Data, that cover method will be used for the particular plot there, and not the one listed here.<br>
        
<br>If methods, projects, or people are not in the picklists below that you would like to use, you may add them using the 'add' buttons.<br>
        
<br>If the bottom section of the form is used, you must press the long button there to update null values in your loading tables.</help>
