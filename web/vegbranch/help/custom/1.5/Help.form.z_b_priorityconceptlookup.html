<p>
<help>This form allows you to specify criteria that VegBranch will use to lookup plant names in your data to find real plant concepts that they match.  It does this by looking in the plantUsage table, trying to find a plantName that matches the name you supplied, and also the criteria you provide here.  See the plantUsage data in the data dictionary for more information on what each field means.</help>
