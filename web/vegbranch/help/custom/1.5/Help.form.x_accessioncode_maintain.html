<h2>Help for 'Possible Conflicts in Accession Codes<!-- [x_accessioncode_maintain]-->'</h2>
<img border="0" alt="in progress: (screen shot of 'Possible Conflicts in Accession Codes')" src="../screenshots/smaller/x_accessioncode_maintain_1.2.png">
<p>
<help>This form gets displayed when you attempt to connect to a new vegbank module, but the accession codes in your loading module (used to link to vegbank module records) cannot be found in the new vegbank module.  Accession codes are unique text codes that identify a record in the vegbank module (ie a particular plantConcept or reference).  If you make a link to a record in one vegbank module and then link to a new one, some accession codes may not be found in the new one, which is called a 'conflict' in this form.  In this case, the links will be removed if you continue and accept the vegbank module.  If you do not wish to lose the links, you can connect to a new vegbank module, without accepting this one.</help>
