<p>
<help>This form shows you the open or closed list values that are attached to fields in vegbank.  For the purposes of VegBranch, this information applies to the vegbank module.  A closed list means that only values listed here may be used in a field.  An open list means that the values here are recommended, but other values may be used if none of these are suitable.  You can show values for only one field or table, or all.</help>
