<help>This form is used to match your comm names (found in several of your loading tables) to vegbank comm concepts.  This process will take a modest amount of time is you have a lot of comm names.  Names that are not matches WILL BE ADDED to the vegbank module, but there information must be included in your CommConcept Loading Table in order for this to happen.</help>
