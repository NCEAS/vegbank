<help>This form allows you to specify criteria that VegBranch will use to lookup comm names in your data to find real comm concepts that they match.  It does this by looking in the commUsage table, trying to find a commName that matches the name you supplied, and also the criteria you provide here.  See the commUsage data in the data dictionary for more information on what each field means.</help>
