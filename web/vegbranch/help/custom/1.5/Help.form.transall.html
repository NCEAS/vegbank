<h2>Help for 'Translate Text Fields<!-- [transall]-->'</h2>
<img border="0" alt="in progress: (screen shot of 'Translate Text Fields')" src="../screenshots/smaller/transall_1.2.png">
<p>
<help>This is the translation form for VegBranch.  It allows you to translate text fields from one set of values to another set of values, such as conforming to our closed or open lists.  You may also supply default values for fields (which are constant).  These will be used to replace null values in you loading module data.  You must press "go" next to each field, and then translate each of the values for that field to a new value to complete this process.</help>
