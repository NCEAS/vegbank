<help>Each white box on this form represents a possible move of data from one table to another.  This form will help you create needed tables from other tables which you may have added data to.  If there are errors that could cause such a move of data to be problematic, an error message will appear in that box.  You should click "error info" and fix errors on that page before trying to move data.</help>
