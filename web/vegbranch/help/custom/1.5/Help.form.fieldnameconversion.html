<help>This form is used to convert your field names to VegBranch field names.  This form appears after you attempt to load data in the "Load Data" form if the field names in your data (either .csv file or .mdb) do not match VegBranch names exactly.  You can save these conversion criteria to use again with another file you'd like to import.</help>
