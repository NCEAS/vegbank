      <p>VegBranch is a Microsoft Access database designed primarily to import legacy
  vegetation plot data.  For more information, please click the "Overview" link above.</p>
<hr/>
<span class="bright bold">IMPORTANT!</span> You will need to download the VegBranch database,
and <b>also</b> a VegBank Module database (Choose below).  You must then <b>unzip both files</b>

and use a folder address like starts with <b>C:\</b> or <b>D:\</b> or another drive letter,
but NOT like this "\\machine\\shareFolder\".  Once you open VegBranch, instructions
will guide you through linking to the VegBank module (see below).

 Lists that are attached to fields in VegBank do change.  When this happens,
 your VegBank Module may become out of sync with VegBank.  Generally, only new values are added; values are rarely removed.
 You can ensure that you have the latest closed and open list values in your VegBank Module by dowloading the following file, UNZIPPING it, 
 then importing it using VegBranch.  From the Main Menu, choose "Learn More and Other Features" then choose the 
 "Update your VegBank Module closed and open list values" button.  Follow the instructions on that form.

<h3>Getting started with VegBranch</h3>
<p>After downloading VegBranch and one of the VegBank module databases, you will need 
 to extract the databases from the zip files (.zip) that you downloaded to the database files (.mdb) 
 that are in the zipped archive.   You can do this with several different programs, such as 
 <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a> or <a href="http://www.pkware.com/">PKZip</a> (some
 versions of windows include an unzipping utility).
</p>
<p>Once you have the Access Databases unzipped, you are ready to start using VegBranch.
Double-click on VegBranch.mdb (or run MS-Access, then open VegBranch.mdb).
</p>
<p>There are a few steps that VegBranch takes to initialize:</p> 
<h4>Connecting to the VegBank module database</h4>
<p>First, VegBranch makes sure that it is connected to a valid VegBank module database.  As you have just downloaded VegBranch, it is
not currently connected to a valid VegBank module database, and you should see the following dialog box, 
asking you if you want to connect to the default vegbank module database, vegbank_module.mdb in the same
folder as VegBranch:<br />
<img src="@vbr_imageserver@connect-dialog.jpg" /><br />
Press YES, and VegBranch will attempt to connect to vegbank_module.mdb in the same folder.  If you have
renamed the vegbank module database or it isn't in the same folder, press NO, and you will 
be shown a form that allows you to browse for the vegbank module database and connect to it.
</p>
<h4>Turning Off Confirmation Messages</h4>
<p>Secondly, VegBranch checks the settings on your computer for Access confirmation messages.  
These messages appear before action queries are run, records are changed, or objects (tables, queries) are deleted.
VegBranch will perform all these operations from time to time, and you will receive hundreds, perhaps thousands of
messages if you have confirmations on.  For this reason, we recommend you let VegBranch turn off your confirmations.  
(If confirmations are already turned off, this form will not appear.)
VegBranch will turn off your confirmations if you click "YES" on the following form:<br />
<img src="@vbr_imageserver@confirmation-dialog.jpg" /><br />
Press YES, and VegBranch will turn off confirmations, but then return confirmations to their
previous settings after exiting VegBranch (unless VegBranch is exited abnormally).  
This will affect all databases opened while VegBranch is open!  For more information, please 
read the "more information..." box at the bottom of the form. <br />
Note: check the box "Do not display this message again..." to have VegBranch always perform the option you choose here 
(always turns confirmations off when loading or always leaves them as is).
