To create the plots_northamerica_map.png file, 
  open vegbank_blank_northam_map.psf in ArcSoftStudio 2000.
  Then fill in on the bottom layer the colors of states and provinces that are appropriate.
  The key is in a separate layer and can be easily changed.
  The bottom layer has states and provinces connected underneath the oceans to make the entire state/province color on a fill.
  The color similarity should be somewhat weak, like 80-100 so that it colors all that you want it to.
