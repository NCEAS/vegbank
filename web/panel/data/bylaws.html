<h4>BYLAW 1.  NAME.  </h4>

<p class="category">The name of this organization shall be the Ecological Society of America Vegetation
Classification Panel, hereafter "Panel."</p>



<h4>BYLAW 2.  NATURE AND OBJECTIVES.</h4>

<p><span class="category">2.1.      Nature.</span>  The Panel is a body of professional
ecologists organized within the Ecological Society of America, hereafter "ESA."</p>

<p><span class="category">2.2.      Objectives.</span>  The objectives of the Panel are to (1)
facilitate and support the development, implementation, and use of a standardized
vegetation classification for the United States; (2) guide professional
ecologists in defining and adopting standards for vegetation sampling and
analysis in support of the classification; (3) collaborate with partner
organizations to maintain scientific credibility of the classification through
oversight of a peer review system; and (4) promote and facilitate international
collaboration in development of vegetation classifications and associated
standards.   </p>


<h4>BYLAW 3.  MEMBERS AND OFFICERS.</h4>

<p  class="category">3.1.       Members.

shall be limited to those persons who have had sufficient training, experience,
and career positions in vegetation science to be considered by professional
ecologists as peers. </p>
