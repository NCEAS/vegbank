<h2>Professional Training for VegBank and the NVC</h2>
<p>Part of the mission of the Panel is to provide training in
the use and revision of the National Vegetation Classification.  This
includes collection of field data, development of new types and revision
of existing types, and documentation of types.</p>
<p>We present workshops at the annual meeting and periodically with groups who request
special training.  The following is a list of those training workshops:</p>
