<h4><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">BYLAW 1. NAME. </font></h4>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The name of this organization

  BYLAW 2. NATURE AND OBJECTIVES.</font></h4>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.1. Nature.</b> The

<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2.2. Objectives. </b>The 
  objectives of the Panel are to (1) facilitate and support the development, implementation, 
  and use of a standardized vegetation classification for the United States; (2) 
  guide professional ecologists in defining and adopting standards for vegetation 
  sampling and analysis in support of the classification; (3) collaborate with 
  partner organizations to maintain scientific credibility of the classification 
  through oversight of a peer review system; and (4) promote and facilitate international 
  collaboration in development of vegetation classifications and associated standards.
