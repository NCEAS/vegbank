<h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract 
  and overview</b></font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Vegetation classification 
  is of central importance to biological conservation for planning and inventory, 
  to resource management for monitoring and planning, and to basic scientific 
  research as a tool for organizing and interpreting ecological information. All 
  of these activities require that ecological units be defined and that their 
  distributions on the landscape be known and understood. Vegetation classification 
  contributes significantly to analysis of ecological problems that vary in scale 
  from persistence of tiny populations of endangered species to global projections 
  of the impact of climate change. Technological advances have made practical 
  large-scale analyses that cross agency jurisdictions or geographic regions and 
  address applied ecological issues as diverse as global change, ecosystem management, 
  and conservation planning. However, all such efforts depend on having available 
  a common set of well defined and broadly accepted classification units.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Through the combined 
  efforts of <a href="http://www.natureserve.org/">NatureServe</a> (formerly called The 
  Association of Biological Information or ABI<sup>*</sup>), the 
  Ecological Society of America Vegetation Panel (ESA-VP), and the Federal Geographic 
  Data Committee (<a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/">FGDC</a>), the United States 
  is on the verge of having its first fully functional, widely-applied vegetation 
  classification system. The federal government has declared the need for a single 
  standard, and on October 22, 1997, the Secretary of Interior, acting as Chair 
  of the Federal Geographic Data Committee, approved the <u><font 
color=blue><a href="http://biology.usgs.gov/fgdc.veg/">Vegetation Information 
  and Classification Standard</a></font></u>, which is now the standard vegetation 
  classification for U.S. federal agencies and their cooperators. Yet, there are 
  still major obstacles to overcome to make such a system operational and broadly 
  accepted. ESA-VP is working in close collaboration with NatureServe and FGDC to draft 
  standards for field data acquisition, type&nbsp; definition, and peer review 
  of proposed additions and changes. The current <u><font color=blue><a 
href="http://esa.sdsc.edu/initv60.htm">draft standards</a></font></u> are available 
  for public comment.&nbsp; A core component is an information infrastructure 
  to manage the anticipated 10<sup>7</sup> plots and 10<sup>4</sup> plant associations 
  required for a national system, and to distribute this information across the 
  web in a continually revised but perfectly archived format.&nbsp; The major 
  goal of this NCEAS-based project is to create a working prototype of the requisite 
  information system for potential adoption by federal agencies and partner organizations.

  references which predate the name change. This allows for consistency in referencing one organization.

  <a name="flow"></a>Information flow in vegetation classification</b></font> 
</h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">To understand 
  the functions of the required information infrastructure for vegetation science, 
  it is necessary to understand the flow of information through the system.&nbsp; 
  </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Vegetation 
    scientists observe and record vegetation in the field.&nbsp; The fundamental 
    unit of vegetation observation is the <i>plot. </i>At a minimum, a plot contains 
    information on location, spatial extent, and the species present with cover 
    values as a measure of importance.&nbsp; A Vegetation Plots Database is needed 
    to store, preserve and distribute plot data that meet recognized minimum standards.</font> 
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Plots are used 
    to classify vegetation.&nbsp; Eventually, each vegetation type will be documented 
    in a Vegetation Classification Database, which will refer to the plots used 
    to develop the types.&nbsp; Proposals to change the classification will be 
    required to be based on plots.&nbsp; All of these plots will be referenced 
    in the Vegetation Classification Database and will be available from the Vegetation 
    Plots Database.<br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The resultant 
    Vegetation Classification Database will be viewable over the web, will be 
    continuously updated, and will be constructed so that the content on any given 
    date will be viewable so as to allow citation in literature and legal contracts. 
    <br>
    <br>
    </font> 
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">All stages 
    in this information flow contain references to plant names, but use of different 
    standards for different plots weakens our ability to compare and synthesize 
    plot data. A concept-based Taxon Database (embedding some of the principles 
    espoused in <a 
  href="http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/biodivinf/docs/IOPI_Model/">Berendsohn 1995</a>) 
    is needed to avoid these problems.</font> </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This database 
  system consists of prototypes of the three core components of the information 
  infrastructure necessary to support the <a href="http://biology.usgs.gov/fgdc.veg/">U.S. 
  National Vegetation Classification</a> (US-NVC).&nbsp; The first component is 
  a Vegetation Plots Database with internet access tools. A Windows based desktop 
  version for private/institutional use is available for data preparation and 
  submission. The second component is a concept-based Taxon Database compliant 
  with anticipated <a 
href="http://www.fgdc.gov/">FGDC</a>, <a 
href="http://www.itis.usda.gov/plantproj/itis/">ITIS</a>, and <a 
href="http://iopi.csu.edu.au/iopi/">IOPI</a> standards and populated with data 
  drawn from the ITIS database. The third component is a concept-based Vegetation 
  Classification Database compliant with anticipated FGDC standards and populated 
  with data from NatureServe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The databases have been designed so as to allow 
  continual revision while simultaneously being perfectly archived so as to allow 
  citation in literature and legal documents. </font></p>

<h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  <a name="process"></a>The development process</font></h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have engaged in a four-stage 
  process for database development. The first stage (July 1999-June 2000) largely 
  consisted of a period of scoping and organizing. This included a major meeting 
  held at NCEAS in October 1999 for the purpose introducing the major participants 
  to the project's background and goals, and for refining the major objectives 
  of the project, the lists of participants, the budget, and the schedule. The 
  kickoff meeting was followed by a search for a staff programmer, which successfully 
  concluded with John Harris starting employment at NCEAS in early July 2000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The second stage of the 
  project (July 2000-January 2001) focused on design and construction of the core 
  plots database. Toward this end back-to-back meetings were held at NCEAS in 
  September 2000. The first, attended primarily by active field ecologists, focused 
  on refinement of the database requirements first articulated in Chapter 3 of 
  the Vegetation Panel draft standards document. The second meeting was attended 
  primarily by data modelers and overlapped the first meeting for a day, thereby 
  facilitating communication between the two groups. The plots data model, initially 
  developed in September and subsequently revised through an iterative process 
  involving various participants from the September meetings, is summarized in 
  section 6 of this document.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Simultaneous with stage 
  two, we conducted a parallel design study for a concept-based taxonomic database. 
  Although it is not our plan for the NCEAS working group to fully develop and 
  implement a national taxonomic database, we consider creation of such a database 
  essential for our planned vegetation information infrastructure, and especially 
  for the process of incorporating legacy plot data collected at different times 
  by different parties using different taxonomic standards. Accordingly, we are 
  collaborating with partner organizations, aiding in the design and implementation 
  of this key database. Toward this end potential database architecture was discussed 
  at the September NCEAS meetings, and Steve Taswell and Robert Peet subsequently 
  collaborated to design a data architecture for possible implementation by both 
  NatureServe and ITIS. Peet and Taswell then joined Janet Gomon (representing ITIS and 
  the FGDC subcommittee on Biological Nomenclature) to host a meeting at the Smithsonian 
  (November 2000) to review the Taswell-Peet model as a candidate for adoption 
  by ITIS and FDGC as a federal standard. (The <a href="http://biology.usgs.gov/fgdc.bio/FGDC_TaxNom.doc">summary 
  of findings from the November 2000 meeting</a> is available at the <a href="http://biology.usgs.gov/fgdc.bio/">FGDC 
  Biological Data Working Group</a> website.) The Working group is continuing 
  to collaborate with the FGDC Biological Data Working Group to develop draft 
  national standards for taxonomic databases. We will include a prototype national 
  plants database employing the proposed FGDC standard as a module of the plot 
  database. NatureServe is also drawing on this modeling effort to build a nation-wide, 
  concept-based database for organisms as a component of their new HDMS database 
  system (Heritage Data Management System).</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Stage three (February 
  - October 2001) has focused on design and development of the database and associated 
  interface tools (including the internet-based toolbox and the desk-top resident 
  tools) for both loading data into and retrieving data from the Vegetation Plots 
  Database. Preliminary interface requirements were developed at the January 2001 
  meeting and were finalized at the October 2001 meeting. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The fourth stage of the 
  project (October 2001 - June 2002) consists of testing and refinement of the 
  database and iterative development of tools for data preparation, data loading, 
  database querying, and manipulation/analysis of extracted data.</font></p>
