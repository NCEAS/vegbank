<p><font color="#000000" size="3">Vegetation classification is of central importance 
  to biological conservation for planning and inventory, to resource management 
  for monitoring and planning, and to basic scientific research as a tool for 
  organizing and interpreting ecological information.  All of these activities 
  require that ecological units be defined and that their distribution on the 
  landscape be known. Technological advances have made practical large-scale analyses 
  that cross agency jurisdictions or geographic regions and address applied ecological 
  issues as diverse as global change, ecosystem management, and conservation planning.  
  However, all such efforts depend on availability of a common set of well-defined, 
  broadly accepted classification units. The US government, through the Federal 
  Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), has approved standards for a national vegetation 
  classification system.  However, before such a system can be operational and 
  broadly accepted, an information infrastructure is needed to manage the anticipated 
  10<sup>7</sup> vegetation plot records and 10<sup>4</sup> plant associations 
  that will form its basis. The focus of the current proposal is the development 
  of such an information infrastructure, designed so that information can be distributed 
  across the web while being both continually updated and perfectly archived.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3">This project will design, develop and test prototypes 
  of the information infrastructure that is necessary to support the U.S. National 
  Vegetation Classification.  A working group will meet periodically at the National 
  Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) to advise the principal 
  investigators as well as a dedicated postdoc/programmer.  The first component 
  of the infrastructure is a stand-alone vegetation plot database.  Plot data 
  provide the essential information that underlies vegetation classification. 
  This database will be designed to allow inclusion of  diverse types of plot 
  data, and will be first tested using 4 large and divergent datasets.  Such data 
  will be useful, not only for revision of the national classification, but also 
  for numerous studies of vegetation composition, structure and dynamics. The 
  second component will be a database that holds the vegetation classification 
  itself. This will include a novel system of tracking the lineage of each recognized 
  vegetation type by establishing a unique record for each type -- start and stop 
  dates for records will never be discarded, allowing  the recognized types and 
  their supporting data to be reconstructed for any time at any time. A third 
  component, to be developed in concept only, is a database that contains the 
  botanical nomenclature needed to identify the species referenced in the other 
  two databases. Plant nomenclature as treated in current databases is inadequate 
  for use in the plots and classification databases because the meanings associated 
  with plant names change, leaving many applications ambiguous.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3">The main purpose of the proposed research is 
  to design and establish a workable system. Once developed and rigorously tested, 
  the prototype databases will likely be adopted and maintained by some combination 
  of The Nature Conservancy (TNC), USGS (NBII), FGDC and the Ecological Society 
  of America (ESA) for the broad benefit of users, which will include agency, 
  academic, and other scientists and managers. These arrangements are presently 
  being formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding among the parties.<br>

  LTREB grant supports continued measurements of the rich assemblage of long-term 
  research plots in and near the Duke Forest and thereby enhances the value of 
  the site as a model system for the study of succession.  The data are currently 
  being used in studies of tree growth and mortality, trajectories of compositional 
  change, spatial patterns of change, impacts of natural disturbances, and predictability 
  of composition. Over the years this project, which began with NSF support in 
  1978, has produced numerous papers and been the focus of at least 6 Masters 
  theses, 8 Ph.D. theses and 4 Postdoctoral studies.  The current grant has supported

  Experiment (ITEX). The goals of the on-going project are: (1) to examine the 
  early responses of tundra plant species, plant communities, and the physical 
  environment to experimental increases in summer temperature and winter snow 
  depth (Walker et al. 1999), (2) to determine responses of natural vegetation 
  to recent decade-scale natural warming, and (3) to work with other ITEX sites 
  worldwide to synthesize initial responses. Major accomplishments of this research 
  have been: (1) leading and completing a comprehensive synthesis of ITEX responses 
  for the first 4 years of experiments worldwide (Arft et al. 1999), (2) analyzing 
  community change at Toolik Lake and Imnavait Creek, Alaska, using a combination 
  of multivariate statistical techniques and deterministic modeling (Markovian 
  analysis) (Walker et al. in prep.), and (3) developing a new model for simulating 
  tundra vegetation change on an annual time step (ArcVeg) (Epstein et al. in 
  prep.).  This work has supported 2 postdoctoral research assistants, one Ph.D. 
  candidate, and numerous undergraduates. It has resulted in over 12 publications

  1.  Introduction</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Vegetation classification is of central importance to biological 
  conservation for planning and inventory, to resource management for monitoring 
  and planning, and to basic scientific research as a tool for organizing and 
  interpreting ecological information.  All of these activities require that ecological 
  units be defined and that their distribution on the landscape be known and understood. 
  Vegetation classification contributes significantly to analysis of ecological 
  problems that vary in scale from persistence of tiny populations of endangered 
  species to global projections of the impact of climate change. Technological 
  advances in fields such as remote sensing and geographic information systems 
  have made practical large-scale analyses that cross agency jurisdictions as 
  well as geographic regions and address applied ecological issues as diverse 
  as global change, ecosystem management, and conservation planning.  However, 
  all such efforts depend on having available a common set of well defined and 
  broadly accepted classification units. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Through the combined efforts of The Nature Conservancy (TNC), 
  the Ecological Society of America Vegetation Panel (ESA-VP), and the Federal 
  Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), the United States is on the verge of having 
  its first fully functional, widely-applied National Vegetation Classification 
  system (NVC). The federal government has declared the need for a single standard, 
  and on October 22, 1997 the Secretary of the Interior, acting as Chair of the 
  Federal Geographic Data Committee, approved the <i>Vegetation Information and 
  Classification Standard</i> (http://biology.usgs.gov/fgdc.veg), which is now 
  the standard vegetation classification for U.S. federal agencies and their cooperators. 
  Yet, there are still major obstacles to overcome to make such a system operational 
  and broadly accepted. ESA-VP is working in close collaboration with TNC and 
  FGDC to draft standards for field data acquisition, type definition, and peer 
  review of proposed additions and changes. A fourth component, an information 
  infrastructure to manage information on the anticipated 10<sup>7</sup> vegetation 
  plot records and 10<sup>4</sup> plant associations required for a national system, 
  and to distribute this information across the web in a continually revised but 
  perfectly archived format, represents a major intellectual and practical obstacle 
  to the realization of the system. It is this critical piece that our proposal 
  addresses.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We propose to establish a research project to be conducted at 
  the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara 
  to design, construct and test prototypes of two core components of the information 
  infrastructure necessary to support the U.S. National Vegetation Classification 
  (US-NVC).  These prototypes will include. First, a stand-alone vegetation plots 
  database system with internet access tools, and second, an addition to the TNC 
  Heritage Data Management System that will allow the national vegetation classification 
  database to be both continually revised and perfectly archived.  Subsets of 
  our research team and collaborators (Table 2) would meet at intervals over a 
  2-yr period to develop and test components of the system. A postdoctoral associate 
  at NCEAS would work in consultation with project coordinators, TNC and federal 
  government analysts, and NCEAS data analysis staff to complete most of the actual 
  design and programming. Data from four divergent but relatively large and mature 
  vegetation classification projects that span the range of data types likely 
  to be incorporated in the system would be used to explore and demonstrate the 
  robustness of the system.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Although additional refinement and management tools may be needed 
  for full implementation, once developed, tested and reviewed the modules of 
  the working prototype would likely be adopted and maintained by TNC, USGS (NBII), 
  FGDC and ESA.  A memorandum of understanding has been agreed to by three of 
  these participants, and the third (FGDC) is expected to follow soon (see Section 
  I - Supplemental Information).  USGS through its National Biological Information 
  Infrastructure (NBII) anticipates maintaining and serving the plots database, 
  and TNC anticipates maintaining and serving the vegetation classification database 
  as part of its Heritage Data Management System. The plant nomenclature database 
  attributes anticipated here are likely to be incorporated within the USDA Plants 
  Database and the USGS ITIS Database. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">NCEAS has agreed to be the focal point for these activities 
  and has awarded the PIs (as representatives of the collaborating organizations)  
  $52,000 in seed money to begin work (see Supplemental Information).  NCEAS 
  will also assist with computational expertise and infrastructure, allow use 
  of its facilities for working group meetings, and house our postdoctoral associate/programmer. 
  The USGS, through its GAP Analysis Program, has pledged an additional $50,000 
  for this Project (with half available in fiscal 1999; see Supplemental Information).  
  TNC is currently developing a new SQL-based Heritage Data Management System, 
  which  will incorporate the bulk of vegetation classification information, and 
  expects to incorporate the proposed community lineage-tracking component module. 
  Nonetheless, the scope and cost of this project are beyond the ability of these 
  organizations to support in full. The NCEAS and GAP funds will be used to cover 
  participant costs for an anticipated eight working group meetings to be held 
  for design and evaluation functions. We are requesting from NSF funds needed 
  to support the programming and testing phases outlined here.  Because this is 
  really one integrated project, we will describe all the pieces in this proposal.</font></p>
<h2><br>
  <font size="4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem Statement</font> </h2>
<h2><font size="4"><i>The ESA Vegetation Panel</i></font></h2>
<p><font size="3">The United States has lagged well behind much of the western 
  world in vegetation classification. In many countries vegetation plot data have 
  been collected and classifications developed using standardized techniques for 
  well over half a century. Synthetic, plot-based treatments of the vegetation 
  of such countries as Great Britain (Rodwell 1991-99), Austria (Mucina et al. 
  1993) and The Netherlands (Schaminée et al. 1995-98) have appeared in recent 
  years, and work is underway on a synthetic treatment of the vegetation of the 
  whole of Europe (Mucina et al. 1993, Rodwell et al. 1995, Mucina and Schaminée 
  <i>in press</i>).  </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Historically, vegetation classification efforts within the United 
  States have been diffuse and uncoordinated. There are no public archives for 
  plot data, and prior to the 1980s there was no significant movement toward a 
  comprehensive national vegetation classification.  During the 1980s several 
  federal agencies and NGOs (including The Nature Conservancy) recognized the 
  need for a standard vegetation classification for conservation and land-use 
  planning and began working on this challenge. The concurrent maturation of remote 
  sensing and GIS technology produced a tremendous increase in the demand for 
  vegetation maps and inventory, and a consequent increase in the number of vegetation 
  classification efforts and approaches. Increased interest in ecosystem management 
  and conservation planning have also driven a demand for accurate maps of the 
  distribution of ecosystem types across landscapes. The ESA Vegetation Panel 
  (all PIs are members) was founded with the objective of providing professional 
  oversight and leadership in the face of diversifying standards for vegetation 
  classification.  At nearly the same time the ESA Vegetation Panel was established, 
  the FGDC Vegetation Subcommittee was established within the Federal Government 
  with the more circumscribed objective of defining one set of national standards 
  for vegetation classification. The FGDC proposed adoption of the vegetation 
  classification system developed by The Nature Conservancy with only minor modifications.  
  This hierarchical system has two primary levels  an upper level defined on 
  the basis of physiognomy (Class through Formation), and a lower level defined 
  on the basis of species composition or floristics (Alliances and Associations). 
  However, only the details of the physiognomic levels were elaborated by the 
  FGDC proposal. The ESA Vegetation Panel quickly developed an advisory relationship 
  with the FGDC Vegetation Subcommittee and provided extensive comment on the 
  proposed national standards.  The FGDC standards, with nearly all the ESA Vegetation 
  Panel suggestions incorporated, were formally adopted by FGDC in October 1997 
  (see http://www.usgs.gov/fgdc.veg/).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Completion of the review of the proposed national vegetation 
  classification standards (and their adoption and publication by FGDC) marked 
  the end of the first phase of the ESA Panel's work.  The focus of the second 
  phase, now in progress, is to propose the basic standards needed to support 
  the floristically-based level of the classification (Alliance and Association). 
  These standards are particularly crucial, as they will define a basis for recognizing 
  ecological assemblages of species. FGDC is largely looking to ESA-VP and TNC 
  to provide leadership for their formulation. A working draft of these standards 
  has been developed by ESA-VP and a draft should be available for review by August 
  1999. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">As part of its current activities, ESA-VP intends to propose 
  NVC standards related to data storage, distribution, and management, both for 
  the classification per se, and for the vegetation plot data needed to document 
  the classification. In February 1997, a special data management and architecture 
  subcommittee of ESA-VP devised an innovative and forward-looking data management 
  and flow system for the US-NVC that anticipates need for a continuously updated, 
  web-distributed system that is, nonetheless, perfectly archived. In essence, 
  this proposal to NSF is intended to refine the ESA-VP data management and architecture 
  concepts, develop the necessary conceptual and logical models, and construct 
  and test prototypes of the core missing components of the information system 
  using data from four case studies. The third phase of the ESA-VP activities 
  will focus on development and implementation of peer review procedures for proposals 
  to add to or revise the Associations and/or Alliances that populate the US-NVC.  
  Realization of these phase three objectives will absolutely depend on completion 
  of the proposed information infrastructure.</font></p>
<h3><font size="3"><i><font size="4"><br>
  Information flow and vegetation classification</font></i></font></h3>
<p><font size="3">Information flow into, through, and out of the US-NVC is central 
  to its purpose and efficient functioning; in effect, information flow defines 
  and holds together all the parts of the US-NVC.  The proposed architecture consists 
  of three linked databases  - one that contains the plot database on which the 
  classification units are based, one that contains the classification itself, 
  and one that contains plant nomenclature information. These databases will each 
  present a &quot;moving target&quot; owing to the continual collection of new 
  plot data, additions to and revision of the vegetation classification, and revisions 
  in plant nomenclature.  Consequently, the system needs to be designed to use 
  Internet-based communication; otherwise it would be impossible to distribute 
  the continually evolving databases in a timely and economic fashion. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Information flow through the proposed US-NVC is shown in Figure 
  1. Information enters in the form of plot data, which are filtered by a review 
  process and stored in standardized format in a national plots database by a 
  management process.  Plots are used to define and describe the Associations 
  that constitute the fundamental units of the vegetation classification in much 
  the same fashion as a type specimen defines a species. Accordingly, proposals 
  for changes in the classification will make explicit reference to plots in the 
  plots database and to related vegetation types in the classification database. 
  All such proposals for changes will go through a review process and a data management 
  process. Both the plots and classification databases will make frequent use 
  of plant names, and plant names change as our understanding of species changes.  
  Consequently, there must be a standard plant nomenclature database with mechanisms 
  for tracking changes and incorporating those changes in the plots and classification 
  databases.  In each case, Internet access should ultimately allow the database 
  to be viewable, searchable, and downloadable, in part or in full, on demand. 
  </font></p>
<h3><font size="3"><br>
  <i><font size="4">Plot data</font></i></font></h3>
<p><font size="3">The fundamental unit of vegetation information is the plot  
  a listing of species names and abundances, combined with various vegetation 
  and site attributes.  In order for the definitions and descriptions of vegetation 
  types in a classification to be scientifically credible, they must be based 
  on plot data that are archived for future study and evaluation.  Nations with 
  a mature national classification invariably have a national plots database populated 
  with a large number of plots, both recent and historic.  For example, the plot 
  database for The Netherlands, a county not much larger than Maryland, has roughly 
  300,000 plots. Indeed, The Netherlands is only one country in a large confederation 
  that is working toward a plot-based European Vegetation Classification that 
  uses a standard sampling and classification protocol (Braun-Blanquet) and a 
  standard set of software tools (TurboVeg, written by Stephan Hennekens) for 
  maintaining and manipulating large plot databases.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We propose to design, construct and implement a prototype plot 
  database program for North American plot data.  Like the TurboVeg software used 
  by the European community, our database system will store plot data in a consistent 
  format and in compact form for local use (the 300,000 plots in Dutch plot database 
  occupy only about 200 Mb of disk space).  It should be accessible over the Internet 
  for searching, extraction and submission. It should allow efficient updating 
  of plant nomenclature, while retaining unchanged the original names reported 
  by the author.  Finally, software tools should be provided for efficient manipulation 
  of subsets of the data. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The collection of vegetation data toward a national classification 
  is in many ways comparable to the Human Genome Project, where independent contribute 
  descriptive data into a pool that collectively forms the essential information 
  infrastructure that allows advancement of the field. We anticipate that the 
  proposed plot database will ultimately come to resemble GenBank in that all 
  workers who describe vegetation will deposit their plot data directly or in 
  one of a linked set of compatible databases. Related disciplines are well ahead 
  of US vegetation science in solving such problems. For example, the paleoecological 
  community has access to the National Pollen Database (http://julius.ngdc.noaa.gov/paleo/napd.htm) 
  which has for the first time made national and international syntheses of paleoecological 
  conditions possible (e.g. Overpeck et al. 1997).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The importance of plot data archives has been recognized within 
  many agencies, and in-house plot databases are in use or are emerging in many 
  organizations, including TNC, USFS, USDA, and USGS-BRD. None of these efforts 
  contains all the attributes or adheres completely to the standards needed for 
  the US-NVC.  Because each organization has its own mission, none of these efforts 
  alone is suitable for a national standard. The history of vegetation classification 
  in the U.S. shows that this vital task has the most likely chance of successful 
  development in an NCEAS-like environment with broad participation of all sectors.  
  Fortunately, USGS-BRD appears committed to serving as steward for the plots 
  database, once it is developed (see MOU in Section I - Special Information).</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The US vegetation ecology community is starting from a background 
  of 100+ years of somewhat chaotic and idiosyncratic vegetation survey and description, 
  and is seeking to attain a massive synthesis that will allow the immediate use 
  of this historical legacy and will focus and refine future work. If appropriate 
  standards, databases and software tools were in place, much existing and most 
  future data could be used by multiple researchers for synthetic purposes. With 
  development and demonstration of the plot database we propose to construct, 
  we hope to catalyze this major, nation-wide synthetic effort.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><i><font size="4"><br>
  A vegetation classification for the United States</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">The US-NVC is evolving out of a series of related efforts. The 
  most comprehensive effort, that of TNC (e.g. Grossman et al, 1998, Anderson 
  et al, 1998; see <span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>http://www.consci.tnc.org/library/pubs/class/index.html</span>), 
  is providing a critical first approximation at a national effort.  TNC developed 
  the overall framework for the current US-NVC and has now identified over 4700 
  vegetation Associations within roughly 1500 Alliances. These Associations and 
  Alliances  will populate on an interim basis the Association and Alliance levels 
  of the US-NVC when the proposed standards are approved.  Although these Associations 
  and Alliances are based on both plot data and qualitative field studies, most 
  have not been comprehensively described using plot data, and rarely if at ever 
  are the data readily accessible for reanalysis.  Considerable revision and expansion 
  will likely occur over the next several decades as we move toward a more fully 
  validated, plot-based classification. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">A key issue in design of the classification database is that 
  the database will continually change as new information is added.  The classification 
  units will represent a &quot;moving target&quot;, and therefore it is of critical 
  importance that the database format allow the classification and species name 
  data to be <i>continually revised, while remaining perfectly archived and Internet 
  accessible</i>. In other words, it must be possible to reconstruct, at any time 
  in the future, the database at any time in the past. Otherwise it would be impossible 
  to reconcile or align differences in data or analyses developed at different 
  times using the same national standard classification database. Another key 
  design issue is that it must be easy to disseminate, easy to update, and easy 
  to maintain local working copies of the data. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Nature Conservancy has developed and is using a pilot classification 
  database in its Biological and Conservation Database System (BCD).  The database 
  maintains the names, codes, descriptions, distribution, environmental conditions, 
  conservation status and much more information about each vegetation Alliance 
  and Association as well as all of the physiognomic levels above them in the 
  classification hierarchy. This system will be upgraded within the next 18 months 
  to a state-of-the-art SQL database system with a Windows user-interface to form 
  the Heritage Data Management System (HDMS).  The HDMS will be web compatible 
  and plans are being developed to make the data available through the web.  The 
  upgraded HDMS system will allow TNC to continue to support and provide access 
  to the national classification database.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The classification database in the initial version of HDMS will, 
  like BCD before it, not have the ability to track changes in the classification 
  in an efficient manner. Consequently, the classification will not be fully archived, 
  which will make it impossible to reconstruct the classification on the date 
  cited in a literature citation or a legal document. Further, TNC has no immediate 
  plans to link HDMS with a plots database, which will limit the ability of scientists 
  to assess the validity of the components of the classification, and the ability 
  of reviewers to evaluate proposed changes.  Finally, the system will have only 
  rudimentary ability to track changes in plant nomenclature.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We propose to build on the extensive design and programming 
  being undertaken by TNC in its development of the HDMS. HDMS will serve as the 
  core of the classification database system.  However, we propose to engineer 
  additional modules and capacities that would  increase the value of and access 
  to the information in HDMS.  These modules would incorporate efficient tracking 
  of changes so that the classification system effective on any given date could 
  be reconstructed.  Linkages to the plot database would also be incorporated 
  in Association records. </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><i><font size="4"><br>
  Botanical nomenclature standards for the United States</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A major challenge in development of plot and vegetation classification 
  databases is the &quot;moving target&quot; nature of plant names. Names may 
  change in meaning as taxa are lumped or split, with the consequence that established 
  rules for botanical nomenclature are inadequate for continuously updated database 
  systems. In a plots database using traditional botanical nomenclature, it is 
  inevitable that some scientific names will be used with multiple meanings, and 
  there will be no clean way to sort out those meanings or to update the nomenclature 
  used in the database.  As a simple example, in 1993<i> Aristida stricta</i> 
  (as then used) was recognized as consisting of both <i>Aristida stricta</i> 
  and <i>Aristida beyrichiana</i> (Peet 1993).  As a consequence, in papers and 
  databases that postdate 1993 <i>Aristida stricta</i> sometimes means<i> Aristida 
  stricta</i> in the narrow (and more meaningful) sense and sometimes in the broad 
  sense; a method is needed to distinguish between the two meanings of <i>Aristida 
  stricta</i>. Even if botanists were to follow the rules of zoological nomenclature 
  and agree to accept without question the most recent nomenclatural interpretation, 
  there would still be ambiguity in nomenclature deriving from data collected 
  at different times.  We anticipate eventual application of a system of &quot;operational 
  taxonomic units&quot; (OTUs), each uniquely associated with one particular application 
  of a species name. All reference to plant species in the US-NVC system (such 
  as in names of Associations and Alliances, descriptions of Associations and 
  Alliances, and the plot database) would be by OTU number rather than traditional 
  nomenclature. Software tools would make such use transparent to the user, except 
  in the case of ambiguities that require human intervention. This approach would 
  allow reconstruction of the precise meaning attached to a species name at any 
  time in the history of the database, and would facilitate updating the nomenclature 
  within the US-NVC as the nomenclature database changes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Some form of plant species database with the equivalent of our 
  OTU numbers will be needed if we are to accurately enter plot data into the 
  plots database, but actual implementation of a national standard OTU database 
  will require extensive consultation with the systematics community and is beyond 
  the scope of the present project. Nonetheless, we foresee adoption of an OTU 
  database as essential and inevitable, and we will design the US-NVC and plots 
  databases to be able to exploit the national standard OTU database at such time 
  as it becomes available. Core personnel from the USDA PLANTS and the USGS  ITIS 
  database projects will be invited to participate in the working group to facilitate 
  future interactions and encourage compatibility between our respective activities.  
  Preliminary discussions with personnel from these programs have revealed considerable 
  interest in and enthusiasm for implementing the changes we are likely to propose 
  for their databases.  Moreover, FGDC is considering establishment of national 
  biological nomenclature and taxonomy standards.  These proposed standards need 
  the equivalent of the OTU number approach if they are to achieve the goals of 
  being continually revised and perfectly archived.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="3">Figure 1. </font></b><font size="3">The central column shows 
  the flow of information on vegetation from its entry as plot data into the plot 
  database to its emergence as output from the classification database.  A parallel 
  flow of information is anticipated for botanical nomenclature. Critical to the 
  functioning of the entire system is the role of partner organizations in the 
  management of information flow into and out of the databases and peer-review 
  of proposed changes.  Development of the requisite partnerships is unlikely 
  without a working demonstration model of the proposed infrastructure.<br>

<p><font size="3"><b><font size="4">3.  Significance of the Research</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Researchers, resource managers, and policy makers all require 
  information on vegetation composition and distribution.  Toward this end large 
  amounts of data are collected in diverse forms, but rarely synthesized and distributed 
  beyond regional projects.  This situation illustrates the fundamental need for 
  sophisticated data storage and archiving systems that is quickly coming to the 
  forefront in ecology. Ellison (1997), drawing heavily on the National Research 
  Councils Bits of Power report (1997), argues eloquently for archiving and 
  sharing data. The combined federal environmental and natural resources research 
  budget for monitoring and related research is $650 million (National Science 
  and Technology Council, 1997). Although the portion of this total budget representing 
  vegetation inventory is surely a modest part of the total, the numbers do suggest 
  the magnitude of this effort. Most vegetation description and inventory data 
  are largely invisible and unavailable to those outside the immediate sphere 
  of collection. If appropriate standards, databases and software tools were in 
  place, existing and future data and their associated analyses could be used 
  by multiple researches for multiple synthetic purposes.  The ESA draft vegetation 
  standards and their proposed databases offer a solution to this problem for 
  a fundamental set of data. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">FGDC has recognized that construction of the floristic components 
  of a US-NVC is too complex for it to handle without further resources and has 
  taken advantage of the opportunity to collaborate with ESA-VP and TNC. The development 
  and demonstration activities that we propose to undertake follow three years 
  of discussion within ESA-VP of how to refine, implement and advance the US-NVC. 
  These discussions have involved a broad cross-section of vegetation scientists 
  from academia, federal agencies, and private organizations. This proposal is 
  the logical outcome of that deliberation.  In effect, it proposes a collaboration 
  among FGDC, TNC, ESA, and USGS (NBII) to fully elaborate, develop, and demonstrate 
  the feasibility of a proposed data architecture for the US-NVC. These organizations 
  have jointly drafted a Memorandum of Understanding stating their intent to cooperate 
  in the development of a US-NVC. TNC, USGS (NBII) &amp; ESA have all agreed to 
  sign, and FGDC is expected to join as well (see Section I - pecial Information). 
  The proposed demonstration project is expected to be sufficient to convincingly 
  demonstrate proof of concept and allow ready implementation by the partner organizations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><br>
  <font size="4">4.  Proposed Activities and Timetable </font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">The specific activities will include: (1) development and testing 
  of a working prototype of a national plots database that would be publicly accessible 
  and searchable via the Internet, (2) development and testing of a working prototype 
  of an additional module for the TNC-HDMS that will allow the vegetation classification 
  to be continually revised and perfectly archived, (3) development of tools for 
  downloading and manipulation of plot data offline for purposes of refinement 
  of the classification, (4) construction a conceptual design for a plant nomenclature 
  database that will allow for the system to be continually revised, perfectly 
  archived, and will remove the ambiguity of meaning intrinsic to current nomenclatural 
  standards, and (5) testing and demonstration of the prototype databases and 
  tools using a diversity of data types.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">As described in the problem statement, the proposed information 
  system would consist of three linked databases - one that contains the classification 
  itself, one containing plant nomenclatural information, and one containing the 
  plot database on which the classification units are based.  Each of these components 
  poses design challenges that would need to be resolved during workshop meetings 
  and subsequently refined and implemented by program personnel.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><i><br>
  <font size="4">Plot database.</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">In order for a national vegetation plot database to function 
  efficiently as a foundation for the NVC, it must possess several critical attributes.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data 
    must be searchable and downloadable through the web.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submission 
    of new data must be easily accomplished through a web interface.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plot 
    records must meet minimum standards as established for purposes of the classification 
    system.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system 
    must be flexible enough to accommodate and retain idiosyncratic attributes 
    of data from a diversity of sources.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system 
    must be sufficiently efficient in storage and computation such that substantial 
    subsets can be housed and manipulated on a personal computer.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The database 
    must be able to accommodate easy submission, searching and downloading of 
    selected data over the Internet.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The database 
    must incorporate fields for multiple species codes, including the nomenclature 
    applied by the original investigator and the nomenclature as updated at future 
    dates.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The database 
    should track use of the various plots as either characterizing or representing 
    vegetation Associations recognized in the US-NVC.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System 
    managers should be able to block confidential information, such as details 
    of plots with rare species.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provision 
    must be made for user-supplied notes and comments.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3">Several plot databases or database programs are in existence, 
  including TurboVeg created as part of the European classification effort, 
  ECADS created by Region 1 of the USFS, &quot;ESIS&quot; created by USDA, and 
  &quot;PLOTS&quot; developed by TNC to support the NPS Vegetation Mapping Program.  
  Each of these programs was created for a specific type of data or for specific 
  applications. Nonetheless, they incorporate valuable design features. During 
  the design of the national plots database, we will review these efforts for 
  useful attributes and overall architectural efficacy.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The degree to which data extracted from a plots database will 
  be valuable for developing and refining the NVC is likely to depend heavily 
  on the availability of software tools for manipulation and summarization of 
  those data. Part of the success in Europe of TurboVeg derives from the associated 
  software tools. We will provide at least minimal tools for data manipulation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><i> <br>
  <font size="4">Classification Database</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">TNC has taken the lead in developing the first two generations 
  of the US-NVC database system and will continue to provide the home for the 
  database.  However, budgetary and time constraints preclude inclusion of many 
  database elements that ESA-VP views as critical.  The proposed project has the 
  potential to build on the on-going TNC efforts and link the product with the 
  plots database to provide a fully operative and integrated information infrastructure 
  for vegetation science.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><span>  </span>The need for a classification database that is 
  constantly revised, yet perfectly archived, presents a special challenge. The 
  ESA-VP Subcommittee on Data Management and Architecture has developed a database 
  design explicitly to handle this problem (Peet et al. 1997). Specifically, the 
  classification database would consist of numbered records that contain fields 
  for tracking at least the number of the element (Alliance or Association), the 
  start date for the record, the stop date for the record, and pointers to or 
  information on attributes of the element, such as its name, composition and 
  distribution.  Records would never be discarded or changed in this plan (except 
  for addition of stop dates as appropriate); at such time as the classification 
  is changed or updated, new records would be generated to supercede old records.  
  This architecture allows the database to be searched for all records in effect 
  on any given date, and thus enables the entire US-NVC to be reconstructed for 
  any given date.  Further, the projected change tracking would support reconciliation 
  of regional classifications from different dates to a common classification 
  for large-scale synthesis.  Local copies would be easy to maintain because updates 
  could be downloaded based on a cutoff date.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The ESA-VP approach to change tracking appears to be an elegant 
  solution, but certainly is not the only possible solution.  For example, Taswell 
  &amp; Goodin (1998) have built on some of the ideas in Peet et al (1997) to 
  develop a somewhat different protocol for tracking changes in the classification 
  that anticipates likely architectural constraints imposed by HDMS. These various 
  approaches and others need to be reviewed by a broader audience to determine 
  the most efficient means of tracking changes in the classification database.  
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><i><br>
  <font size="4">Taxonomic (OTU) Database</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Both the plots database and the classification database make 
  extensive reference to scientific names of plants. Consequently, a standard 
  is needed for plant names.  However, candidate standards, such as the USDA PLANTS 
  database and the USGS ITIS database do not currently allow tracking of changes 
  in use of species names.   To solve this problem, we propose essentially the 
  same change tracking strategy as proposed for the community classification.  
  All reference to plant species in the US-NVC system (such as in names of communities, 
  descriptions of communities, and the plot database) will be by OTU number, rather 
  than traditional nomenclature. OTU numbers are similar to the record numbers 
  in the US-NVC in that they include a start date, stop date, and pointers to 
  attributes. Any change in the botanical nomenclature database would generate 
  a new record(s) with a new OTU number(s). Thus, if a species were split into 
  two species, the original OTU would be replaced by two new OTU numbers, even 
  though the Latin binomial would be retained for one of the two products of the 
  split. This approach would allow reconstruction of the precise meaning attached 
  to a species name at any time in the history of the database, and would facilitate 
  updating the nomenclature within the US-NVC as the nomenclature database changes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3">A developing multi-agency project, the Integrated Taxonomic 
  Information System (ITIS, see http://plants.usda.gov/itis/), incorporates some 
  design elements required for the OTU system. In addition, a reengineering of 
  the USDA PLANTS database is planned with the key individuals showing considerable 
  interest in incorporation of the OTU system.   We plan to include personnel 
  from both ITIS and PLANTS in the nomenclature database design meeting so as 
  to provide a clearer view of our needs and of how they might implement change 
  tracking.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><i><br>
  <font size="4">Demonstration Datasets</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">The prototype plot database system will be tested and refined 
  using plot data from four large and well-developed datasets that represent some 
  of the more important forms of plot data currently collected or available, and 
  which, through their diversity, should demonstrate the robustness of the system 
  developed.  One dataset is currently being compiled by TNC for the Greater Yosemite 
  vegetation mapping project integrating new plot data with existing plot data 
  originally collected by several different agencies and organizations.  Close 
  proximity of researchers working on the Yosemite project to our program office 
  in Santa Barbara will allow development activities to proceed without the necessity 
  of convening a Working Group meeting.  Two other datasets were developed and 
  are maintained by project PIs, one for North Carolina vegetation (Peet) and 
  one for arctic and boreal vegetation (Walker). Finally ESA-VP member Robert 
  Pfister has agreed to make available portions of the massive Forest Service 
  data archive for the Northwestern states.</font></p>

  <br>
  <font size="4">Work Plan</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">The activities will be designing, testing, and refining the 
  prototype database system.  These will be accomplished by two functions: (a) 
  a series of working group meetings to explore conceptual and design issues; 
  and (b) tasks associated with the direct assembly, construction and testing 
  of the prototypes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The primary activity will be design, programming and refinement 
  of the prototypes of the two component database systems (US-NVC and Plots), 
  and conceptual design of a species nomenclature database system. This will be 
  accomplished over a 2-year period, with 8 working group meetings and a supporting 
  postdoctoral fellow with expertise in SQL programming. We envision this to be 
  a recent graduate specifically interested in the field of science information 
  management. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">The project will benefit from the extensive experience and participation 
  of TNC data management staff to the extent of at least 6 person months of participation 
  as a matching contribution. This participation is viewed as key by TNC because 
  it would assure compatibility with their on-going database development activities.  
  The postdoctoral fellow will be housed in Santa Barbara at NCEAS where he or 
  she can interact with and receive advice from a permanent staff dedicated to 
  data analysis and computer support for synthetic ecological research.  All working 
  group meetings will be conduced at NCEAS.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We anticipate that the projected 21 working group members will 
  be assigned to one or more of four subgroups.  Subgroup 1 will be responsible 
  for developing the plot database, subgroup 2 will be responsible for developing 
  the change tracking capability for the classification database, and subgroup 
  3 will be responsible for identifying mechanisms to track plant species nomenclature.  
  Each of subgroups 1-3 will contain 2-3 individuals assigned the role of analyst 
  (with the post-doc/programmer acting as one of the analysts for each subgroup). 
  Subgroup 4, consisting primarily of the principle investigators (steering committee) 
  and the analysts, will be responsible for oversight and synthesis of the data 
  systems, and will meet to review, test and refine the coordinated systems once 
  assembled.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Subgroups 1 and 2 will be responsible for developing the conceptual 
  model for their assigned database.  They will participate during their first 
  meeting in a user needs analysis&quot; and will identify the data to be managed, 
  appropriate linkages among the data, and any other critical functionality for 
  the system (e.g., data import/export requirements for the plot database).  They 
  will anticipate the types of data manipulation and reporting that will be required 
  of the system.  At a second meeting approximately one month later, the analysts 
  within the subgroup will have a small meeting for the purpose of drafting the 
  logical model for the database. At a third meeting the subgroup will review 
  the database functionality and will participate in its testing.  The analysts 
  will be responsible for taking the conceptual model developed by the subgroup 
  and developing a logical model that identifies the specific fields, tables, 
  linkages, and other utilities of the system.  Once the logical model is completed, 
  the analysts will give the logical model to the post-doc/programmer who will 
  be responsible for developing the physical model and actually programming the 
  database.  Subgroup 3 will meet with subgroup 2 because of the similarity of 
  the lineage tracking problems to be confronted, but will only go so far as to 
  develop the user needs analysis and evaluate the changes needed in current taxonomic 
  databases to meet those needs.<br>

  <font size="4">Anticipated Results and Beneficiaries </font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Our primary goal is for this project to provide sufficient proof 
  of concept for the US-NVC database system architecture to catalyze formation 
  of a national-level partnership to maintain and promote the use and growth of 
  the component databases.  The Memorandum of Understanding among ESA, TNC, USGS 
  and FGDC currently awaiting signatures indicates interest in such a partnership. 
  USGS and TNC have indicated interest in housing the plots and classification 
  databases respectively. As FGDC and key federal agencies already support the 
  effort in concept, our hope is that a formal partnership agreement would, as 
  a result of this project, arise between ESA (with the role of peer review), 
  TNC (with the role of providing database structure, most initial data, and maintenance 
  of the classification database), and the USGS-NBII (with the role of long-term 
  plot database and botanical nomenclature database support and maintenance).  
  Working prototypes should be sufficient to assure feasibility and facilitate 
  implementation.  [As of January 1999, TNC is undergoing organizational changes 
  that may lead to a separation of its science and preservation activities into 
  two organizations, but both groups have expressed a desire to continue to participate 
  as key partners.]</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We expect that the prototype plots database could be placed 
  in operation almost immediately after completion of the project. The system 
  proposed would provide a stable, long-term repository for data and will give 
  contributors and users a formal mechanism for proper citation of data. Ultimately, 
  the beneficiaries will include all scientists who wish quantitative information 
  on vegetation composition or species distribution for synthetic overview, revision 
  of classification, conservation planning, identification of ecological or biogeographic 
  patterns, or documentation of composition change.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Initial design work for the OTU database has the potential to 
  lead to a new standard for taxonomic nomenclature appropriate for the electronic 
  age that would apply not only to plants, but to all organisms. The general approach 
  will be tested with community names, and sufficient design discussion will be 
  undertaken to structure follow-on activities among the PLANTS and ITIS database 
  managers and the proposed new FGDC subcommittee on biological nomenclature.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The module for the NVC database should serve at least minimally 
  to upgrade the TNC-HDMS platform for the US-NVC, thereby giving the nascent 
  US-NVC the desired attributes of being continually updated and perfectly self-archived.  
  Ultimately this should facilitate development of a peer-review process for changes, 
  which might be run collaboratively with the ESA-VP. The direct beneficiaries 
  will be individuals and organizations that wish to inventory or manage natural 
  resources, preserve or document biodiversity, or document the ecological context 
  of specific observations.  The strategies developed should be generalizable 
  and should thereby benefit users and creators of vegetation classifications 
  worldwide.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We anticipate publication of two or more journal articles outlining 
  both the vision and implementation of the database system.  A general overview 
  of the system and its role in ecology should be appropriate for <i>BioScience</i>, 
  whereas the details of the system architecture and conceptual models should 
  be appropriate for <i>Applied Vegetation Science</i>.</font></p>
