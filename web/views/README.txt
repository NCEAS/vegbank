This talks about how to make "views" using jsp file and SQLStore and autogenerated files.

step 1: 
 -- from /vegbank/web/   call ant views-autogen
 
 this runs the database model (/docs/xml/db_model_vegbank.xml) against the autogen stylesheet (dbmodel-to-jsp-autogen.xsl) and creates views for each table in the db, according to db model (fields listed for each view)
 
 then use /docs/xml/dbmodel-to-jsp-template.xsl to create the sample /views/*.jsp, naming it {table}_{view}.jsp
 
 then call these with URL : /get/{view}/{table}/{PK|accessionCode}[,PK|accessionCode]*
