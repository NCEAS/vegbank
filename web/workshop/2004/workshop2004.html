  July 31-Aug 1, 2004 Workshop <br/>

  <h2>Introduction to VegBank: <br />
    An online public archive for vegetation plots </h2>
</div>
<h3><b><br>
  Overview</b></h3>
<p>The ESA Vegetation 
  Classification Panel has recently released VegBank (<a href="http://vegbank.org">http://vegbank.org</a>) 
  as the first online public archive for vegetation plots.  This workshop aims 
  to introduce the participants to the capabilities of VegBank with particular 
  emphasis on locating and extracting vegetation datasets from VegBank for personal 
  analysis and contributing data to the archive for sharing with the ecological 
  community.  The Panel sees plant community ecology as being on the brink of 
  a dramatic transformation that will be made possible by the emergence of the 
  new field of ecoinformatics with major impacts across the discipline from community 
  theory and vegetation modeling to classification, management and restoration. 
  Central to this transformation will be access to large data archives such as 
  represented by VegBank.</p>
<p>The workshop will 
  first introduce users to the overall organization and structure of VegBank, 
  including novel but essential features such as concept-based taxonomy for plant 
  taxa and vegetation communities, including the relationship of VegBank to the 
  National Vegetation Classification (NVC/IVC) database.  We will train participants 
  to efficiently search for and extract plots for analysis.  Participants will 
  also explore the various data potentially associated with plots, such as the 
  taxa observed on the plot, location information, soil attributes, disturbance 
  history, communities to which the plot has been assigned, notes by other users 
  about the plot, and other user's interpretations of communities and taxa.</p>
<p>Finally, the workshop 
  will train users in data preparation and submission to VegBank using the desktop 
  tool VegBranch.  Many issues pertaining to data irregularities will be addressed, 
  such as standardizing data to match constrained lists of values, matching plant 
  taxonomy to that found in VegBank, handling irregular taxa that ecologists routinely 
  report (e.g. hairy grass  #1), and adding metadata that are not part of the original 
  dataset. Participants who successfully complete the course will be awarded the 
  status of "Certified User." Certified users may upload and download plot data, 
  and may add annotations and interpretations to plot records.</p>
<h3><b><br>
  Logistics &amp; Applications</b></h3>
<p>The Workshop will be held on Saturday and Sunday before the Annual Meeting (July 31-Aug 1, 2004).  Computers 
  will be provided for the hands-on exercise.  Space is limited to 25 participants. 
  Due to this 
  limitation and the specialized nature of the workshop, all those wishing to 
  participate MUST apply and be accepted.</p>
<p>Applications 
  are due June 15, 2004.  </p>
<p>Graduate 
  student participants will receive <b>full reimbursement</b> of the workshop 
  registration fee.</p>
