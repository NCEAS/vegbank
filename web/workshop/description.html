<P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is currently no 
public archive for vegetation plot data in the U.S or elsewhere, yet such an 
archive is critical for plot storage, plot identification and access, and for 
plot documentation and citation. Such a repository is especially needed for 
obtaining, synthesizing, and documenting the large number of field observations 
needed to classify, describe, and name vegetation types, particularly for the 
U.S. National Vegetation Classification (US-NVC). The ESA Panel on Vegetation 
Classification has been developing <A 
href="/index.html">VegBank</A> to meet this need. For 
vegetation plot data VegBank is expected to function in a manner analogous to 
GenBank in that primary data will be deposited for reference and reanalysis. 
VegBank is intended to be directly linked to vegetation types and description 
maintained in the USVC classification database. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This workshop will introduce 
  attendees to the functions and applications of VegBank in vegetation science 
  by walking participants through all phases of the classification process, from 
  collection and entry of original field plot data to extraction of preexisting 
  complementary plot data, data set integration, subsequent analysis, documentation, 
  and final archiving. Workshop participants will first visit a range of vegetation 
  types in the Santa Catalina Mountains, after which they will divide into five 
  crews deployed to different field locations. They will use the Panel's "<A href="/vegbank/panel/standards.html">Standards 
  for Floristic Vegetation Classification</A>" as a basis for collecting field 
  data that will be entered into VegBank. The second day will be spent in a computer 
  teaching lab at the University of Arizona. There participants will download 
  the VegBank client tool, upload field data to the client, query the central 
  database for related plots, and develop an amalgamated set of plot data for 
  classification. They will then output a set of plot data for initial analysis. 
  Participants will end the workshop by employing analytical tools to evaluate 
  their derived data with respect to current floristic descriptions of vegetation 
  types in the USVC. </FONT></P>
