<h1>Annotate Data</h1>
<p>

VegBank receives its data from the <strong>VegBank community of users</strong>.

Once users have loaded data, other users may add comments, or <strong>annotate</strong>
other users' data.  The VegBank database is set up so that data is never overwritten,
but new data may be added in certain areas.

</p>

<p>The main ways to annotate data are:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Adding notes</li>
   <li>Interpreting plants observed on a plot to a 
    particular <a href="javascript:getHelpFor('plant-taxa');">plant concept 
      <img src="@images_link@question.gif" alt="?" /></a>
   </li>
   <li>Classifying plots to a particular 
     <a href="javascript:getHelpFor('plant-communities');">community concept 
     <img src="@images_link@question.gif" alt="?" /></a> 
   </li>
</ul>

<p>When you view a plot, there can be many interpretations of each plot
as a different community.  Certified VegBank users can interpret plots to one
or more communities.  Each user may have a different opinion.  Similarly, each
plant observed on a plot may have more than one interpretation of which plant concept
it matches.  Certified users may make these interpretations as well, and each user
may have a different answer.
</p>
<p>This means that you, the user, will need to decide which interpretation to use
when there are multiple interpretations.  Currently, there are very few cases of multiple
interpretations in the database.  But as users make interpretations, you will likely 
gain a better idea for what a plant on a plot is or what community a plot represents.
As annotations increase, we plan to create preset filters that allow you to automatically
view the most recent interpretation, the best fit-confidence pattern interpretation, or
the original interpretation.

<h4>To Annotate</h4>
<p><strong>a plant</strong>, view details of the plant <a href="@get_link@std/taxonobservation/VB.TO.88719.ACERRUBRUML">[example]</a>
on a plot view <a href="@get_link@comprehensive/observation/VB.Ob.3801.GRSM261">[example]</a>.
Then follow the instructions on the form.  You'll need to know which plant concept you want to
annotate to.  This can be found using the <a href="@forms_link@PlantQuery.jsp">Plant Query</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>a plot</strong>.  The Interpretation of a plot to a community functionality is 
currently being developed.  Coming soon! </p>
<p><strong>a note</strong>.  We plan to build the "Adding Notes" functionality sometime in late 2005.
