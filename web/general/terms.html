  <a href="http://www.esa.org/">Ecological Society of America</a> as a public 
  service. It is the intent of ESA to work with partner organizations to assure 
  the long-term availability of data deposited in VegBank so as to allow citation 
  of the information in scholarly works and other derivative products. Nonetheless, 
  in so doing ESA makes no guarantees as to the long-term maintenance or availability 
  of information deposited in VegBank. In addition ESA provides no warrantee or 
  guarantee as to the accurateness or completeness of the information in VegBank.</p>
<p>ESA reserves 
  the right to reject submissions that appear not to meet standards for submission 
  published in the <a href="@panel_link@standards.html">Vegetation Panel standards document</a>. 
  The primary check will be a software filter applied at time of submission, but 
  subsequent review by management staff may also lead to rejection. The submitter 
  will be notified by email if a submission is later rejected. </p>
