  <h2>Cite or Link to VegBank</h2>
  <h4>Why Cite or Link?</h4>
  <p>One of the biggest advantages of VegBank is that the data that are
  stored in it are <strong>permanently archived</strong>.  This means 
  that you can cite a plot in VegBank, and others will be able to 
  follow your citation hyperlink to see the same data you saw.  
  </p>
  <h4>How do I cite?</h4>
  <p>Citation to VegBank requires that you know the <strong>Accession Code</strong>
  of the plot (or other data) to which you want to link.  An Accession Code is a unique
  code that tells VegBank what data you are interested in.  This can be found on the detailed
  views of plots (and other data).  </p>
  
  <p>Once you know the Accession Code of a plot, you can cite it by
  using the following URL (to type into a web browser) formula: </p>
  <p>http://vegbank.org/cite/[AccessionCode]</p>
  <p>[AccessionCode] is the Accession Code of the plot you are interested in.</p>
  
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>Cite <a href="@cite_link@VB.Ob.3736.GRSM125">this plot</a>
  with the following URL: http://vegbank.org/VB.Ob.3736.GRSM125 </p>
  
  <p>Cite <a href="@cite_link@VB.CC.5728.CEGL003906">this community</a>
    with the following URL: http://vegbank.org/VB.CC.5728.CEGL003906 </p>
  
  <p>Cite <a href="@cite_link@VB.PC.54588.SPOROBOLUSAIROI">this plant</a>
    with the following URL: http://vegbank.org/VB.PC.54588.SPOROBOLUSAIROI </p>
