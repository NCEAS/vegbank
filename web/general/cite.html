  <h2>Cite or Link to VegBank</h2>
  <h4>Why Cite or Link?</h4>
  <p>One of the biggest advantages of VegBank is that the data that are
  stored in it are <strong>permanently archived</strong>.  This means 
  that you can cite a plot in VegBank, and others will always be able to 
  follow your citation hyperlink to see the same data you saw.  
  </p>
  <h4>How do I cite?</h4>
  <p>Citation to VegBank requires that you know the <strong>Accession Code</strong>
  of the plot (or other data) to which you want to link.  An Accession Code is a unique
  code that tells VegBank what data you are interested in.  This can be found on the detailed
  views of plots (and other data).  </p>
  
  <p>Once you know the Accession Code of a plot, you can cite it by
  using the following URL (to type into a web browser) formula: </p>
  <p>http://vegbank.org/get/[view]/[type of data]/'[AccessionCode]'</p>
  <p>[view] is the type of view you want shown, the default is "std" for the standard view, which is always available.  
    "summary" and "detail" are generally also available.</p>
  <p>[type of data] is the entity that you are citing, usually "observation".</p>
  <p>[AccessionCode] is the Accession Code of the plot you are interested in.</p>
  
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>Cite <a href="@get_link@std/observation/'VB.Ob.3736.GRSM125'">this plot</a>
  with the following URL: http://vegbank.org/get/std/observation/'VB.Ob.3736.GRSM125' </p>
