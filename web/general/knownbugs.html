<h1>VegBank Known Bugs</h1>

<p>As with any website that attempts to 
provide dynamic content and advanced features,
some things are bound to fail on certain browsers, or for certain conditions.
We strive to make everything work according to web standards,
and generally this results in good functioning on all browsers.  This
is not always the case though.  For recommended configuration and requirements,
please see <a href="@general_link@requirements.html">Our Requirements Page</a>.
</p>
<p>minor bugs mean slight imperfection in display, but functions correctly. <br/>
   Moderate bugs mean some malfunctioning, but still quite usable. <br/>
   MAJOR bugs mean does not function. </p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>minor</strong> <i>Windows, Internet Explorer</i>: in the tutorial, the content of the main page
  spills over into the scroll bar if the page is too narrow.  Browser bug.</li>
 <li><strong>Moderate</strong> <i>All platforms/browsers</i>: searching for
  data using non-ASCII characters (e.g. &aring;,&agrave;,&eacute;,&ntilde;,&uuml;) doesn't get you the matching data.
  Solution: use wildcards for these characters (e.g. search for "Hult%n" instead of "Hult&eacute;n").</li>
 <li><strong>Moderate</strong> Sorting in some views uses some JavaScript
  which fails in some browsers on some platforms, specifically: <i>Mac, Internet Explorer</i>
  sorting not possible.  <i>Windows, Opera</i> tables get really wide after sorting. 
  Solution: use the default sort order, or download the data and sort in your
  own program, or use a different browser that sorts properly.</li>
 <li><strong>MAJOR: </strong> <i>Windows, Opera</i> datacart adding doesn't work. Solution:
 unknown, but we are trying to fing one.</li>
</ul>
