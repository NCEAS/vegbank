  <h2>VegBank is being upgraded to a new server</h2>  
  <h4>How will this affect me?</h4>
  <p>VegBank will be read-only for a short time, about 30 minutes.  There will be a message at the top of each screen indicating VegBank is read-only.</p>
  <p>While VegBank is read-only, you <strong>will</strong> be able to:</p>
  <ul>
	  <li>Browse the website normally.</li>
	  <li>Search for plots, plants, communities.</li>
     <li>Add items to a dataset -- <strong>however these items will be lost when the new VegBank goes online.</strong></li>
	 <li>Download datasets, map data.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>While VegBank is read-only, you <strong>will not</strong> be able to:</p>
 <ul>
	   <li>Add plots.</li>
	   <li>Interpret plots to a community.</li>
	   <li>Interpret plants.</li>
	   <li>Register as a user of VegBank</li>
	   <li>Request certification</li>
   </ul>  
	   
   <p>Thank you for your patience.  We hope that the short inconvenience will be worth the faster, more efficient VegBank server that will soon be ready.</p>
