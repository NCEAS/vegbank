  <h4><a href="@forms_link@RegisterNewUser.jsp">Register</a> to become a VegBank User.</h4>
  <ul><li>If you don't yet have an account and would like to create one, please follow the above link.
    Please note that you do not need to register to access data in VegBank, but you will have to register
    and request certification to add data.  You may also want to register to permanently keep
    datasets (certification not required).
    </li></ul>

  <h4><a href="@general_link@login.jsp">Login</a> or <a href="@web_context@Logoff.do">Logout</a></h4>
      <ul><li>Logging in allows you to access your account and personal settings, such as datasets.  
      Logging out after you are finished protects your account from being changed by the next user (on your computer).
      Note that VegBank will prompt you to log in if you try to access a feature that requires logging in.
