  VegBank Instructions</h2>
<p>The Vegbank Instruction 
  Manual is currently in progress. <font color="red"><b>NEW!</b></font><br/><br />
  Click <a href="@jspHelpPage@">here</a> to start.</p>
<p>
This will open up the VegBank Manual, or Instructions.  Your browser should be able to handle
frames to use this manual.  Some links may require that your browser support javaScript, too.
You can link directly to a help topic by clicking the "Help" link in the footer of a page, if
it appears (indicating that help is available).
</p>
<p>
Once the manual is open, you will see the normal VegBank website screens on the left and a short
set of instructions on the right.  You may move between instructions by pressing the "previous" and "next"
buttons.  You may also use the picklist below the "Menu" button. Click the "Menu" button to see the full
list of topics in the VegBank manual.  Any links in the text of the right frame should open links
in the left frame.  This way you can click through VegBank forms without losing the instructions.</p>
