  </h2>

     order for VegBank to function properly on your computer.  A list of specific known bugs
     in VegBank can <a href="@general_link@knownbugs.html">be found here</a>.</p>
  <h3>Browser Requirements and Recommendations</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>An up-to-date browser, such as:
       <ul>
         <li><a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox 1.0</a> <b>recommended</b> 
           - fully functional
         </li>
         <li>Internet Explorer 6.0 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Win</a> 
           | <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/internetexplorer/internetexplorer.aspx?pid=internetexplorer">Mac</a> 
           - fully functional
         </li>
         <li><a href="http://browser.netscape.com/">Netscape 7.0 + </a> 
           - fully functional
         </li>
         <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari 2.0</a> 
           - fully functional
         </li>
         <li><a href="http://opera.com/">Opera 8.0</a> 
           - some advanced features, such as datacart, do not work.
         </li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>JavaScript enabled.
       <ul>
         <li>Specifically, Javascript is necessary for queries and datacart functions.  
           Javascript is also used for highlighting in the tutorial and FAQ. 
         </li>
         <li>If you are having problems with datacart or queries, check your browser properties
           to see if Javascript is enabled.  Also, check any third party browser security programs
           like Norton Internet Security, to see if they are restricting Javascript. 
         </li>
       </ul> 
     </li>
     <li>Frames enabled.
       <ul>
         <li>Frames are used in the tutorial and in some VegBranch documentation. 
           Limited functionality without frames may or may not exist. 
         </li>
       </ul> 
     </li>
     <li>Cookies enabled.
       <ul>
         <li>Cookies are used if you login to remember who you are.  Additionally, the datacart
           uses a session cookie to remember who you are if you add plots to the datacart without 
           logging in.
         </li>
       </ul> 
     </li>
     
   </ul>
