  Overall architecture of the vegetation plot module.</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1. Vegetation plots can be viewed 
    as occurring at a locality.</p>
  <p>2. A plot observation occurs at 
    the locality. Plot databases contain site information and taxon co-occurrence 
    data collected at the plot.</p>
  <p>3. Plots in plot databases can 
    be interpreted as representing communities (syntaxa) that exist in community 
    classifications.</p>
  <p>4. Plot observations/collectiuons 
    include observations/specimens of one or more taxa. These same organisms can 
    be observed in multiple plots.</p>
  <p>5. Organisms can be interpreted 
    as representing biological taxa that exisit in various classifications.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>1. A research project can 
          contain one or more plot observations. The project contains information 
          that is in common among all the observations that belong to the project.</p>
        <p>2. Plots can contain plots. 
          Each subplot references its parent plot through a recursive foreign 
          key to another plot. </p>
        <p>3. A plot record contains 
          or references information about attributes of the plot that will not 
          change between temporally displaced observations of the plot.</p>
        <p>4. An observation contains 
          or references information about attributes that might differ between 
          observation events.</p>
        <p>5. A plot most have at least 
          one observation and can have several observations, each of which references 
          the parent (earlier) observation via a recursive foreign key to that 
          observation.</p>
        <p>6. An observation can be 
          interpreted (by one or more parties) at one or more times as belonging 
          to one or more particular types of vegetation. A vegetation type corresponds 
          to a &quot;community concept&quot; in the community taxonomy module. 
          Because vegetation can change, there is no necessary relationshIp between 
          the interpretations at different observation events for a plot.</p>
        <p>7. At each observation event, 
          plant taxa are observed and their attributes are recorded. </p>
        <p>8. Each plant taxon observed 
          is interpreted as belonging to a particular plant concept in the plant 
          taxonomy module. Taxa can be assigned various interpretations at various 
          times by various parties. </p>
