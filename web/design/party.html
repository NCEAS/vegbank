  Party relationships</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1. A <a href="/dd/party">party</a> 
    is a person or organization that contributes to one or more plots. That contribution 
    can be via a <a href="/dd/projectcontributor">project</a>, 
    an <a href="/dd/observationcontributor">observation</a>, 
    <a href="/dd/classcontributor">intepretation 
    of an observation as belonging to a community</a>, or <a href="/dd/taxoninterpretation">interpretation 
    of a taxon as belonging to a plant concept</a>.</p>
  <p>2. A party (e.g., person) 
    can belong to a party (e.g. organization). This relationship is recorded through 
    a recursive foreign key to the parent party. Parties may also have a parent 
    and child relationship owing to a name change.</p>
  <p>3. Parties have multiple 
    <a href="/dd/address">addresses</a> and <a href="/dd/telephone">telephone 
    numbers</a>. Obsolete but archival addresses are retained, with the current 
    address indicated via a currency flag.</p>
  <p>4. A party contributes 
    to projects in various ways via specific <a href="/dd/aux_role">roles</a>.
