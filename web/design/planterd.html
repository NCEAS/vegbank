<blockquote> 
  <p>Plant names are stored 
    in a table called <a href="/dd/plantname">plantName</a>. 
    Taxon concepts are stored in <a href="/dd/plantconcept">plantConcept</a>, 
    which points to a literature citation (<a href="/dd/reference">reference</a>) 
    and the name (<a href="/dd/plantname">plantName</a>) 
    used in the reference. This couplet is sufficient to identify a taxon concept. 
    The name that currently applies to a concept (in the perception of a <a href="/dd/party">party</a>) 
    is mapped in the <a href="/dd/plantusage">plantUsage</a> 
    table, which contains a start and stop data for that name application. A particular 
    party's view as to the status of a particular taxon concept (e.g., recognized, 
    nonstandard) and the start and stop dates for that status are recorded in 
    <a href="/dd/plantstatus">plantStatus</a>. 
    The standard taxon concept that a nonstandard concept maps to (in the perspective 
    of a party) is identified through the contents of <a href="/dd/plantcorrelation">plantCorrelation</a>, 
    together with an indication of the degree of convergence (equal, larger, smaller, 
    overlapping). Predecessor and successor taxa ion the usage of a party can 
    be tracked via a <a href="/dd/plantlineage">plantLineage</a> 
    table. Original descriptions can be provided in <a href="/ddfull/plantconcept/plantdescription">plantDescription</a> (a field in plantConcept)
    for taxa that do not conform to international codes but which are needed for 
    plot records (e.g., hairy Poaceae, fleshy rosette, <i>Potentilla canadensis-simplex</i> 
    complex).<br>
