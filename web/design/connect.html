    The three component databases (plot, community, and plant taxon entities) 
    have been designed and implemented on the Oracle 8i, Postgresql 7.1, and HypersonicSQL 
    RDBMS. In addition to the back-end database implementations, software has 
    been written to allow web access. This software allows a user to query vegetation 
    data for multiple attributes stored in the databases. Queries are stored in 
    the userÂ’s profile records for future reuse or modification. </span></p>

    We have developed a Java desktop client tool that has two purposes: (1) to 
    connect with the application server (using http) in order to perform operations 
    more extensive than those provided to browser-clients (such as data-validation, 
    and data transformation); and (2) to manage vegetation data locally, at the 
    workstation level and in the field. Users of this application client tool 
    can store personal plot data as well as plot data extracted from VegBank in 
    an embedded database identical in design to the database resident on <span
style='font-size:11.0pt;'>the VegBank server. The embedded client solution is 
    the pure-Java HypersonicSQl RDBMS, which allows it to be run on any operating 
    system. </span></p>

    architecture. </span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'><br>
    This web-based system is based on a typical three-tiered architecture that 
    is comprised of a client, application-framework, and a back-end database. 
    The middle-tier was implemented using Java Servlet technology, XML (eXtensible 
    Markup Language) for communication, and Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC). 
    Due to the open and flexible nature of the implementation tools, we can and 
    do deploy the VegBank enterprise on a number of platforms and database engines. 
    The data loader framework currently being used leverages a Java plug-in framework 
    that allows a flexible interface for legacy data to be inported into the VegBank 
    database. We have written loader plug-ins for the <a
href="http://biology.usgs.gov/npsveg/tools/plotsdatabase.html">USGS-NPS Vegetation 
    Mapping Program Plots Database</a>, the <a
href="http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg/">TurboVeg</a> 
    database system (Hennekens &amp; Schaminee 2001) and the <a
href="http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/peet/lab/CVS/NCVS_Protocol/Pulse_Guide.pdf">Carolina 
    Vegetation Survey protocol</a> (Peet et al. 1998). In addition, we are designing 
    a more flexible class to load data stored in a variety of ASCII formats. Simple 
    form-driven data entry will also be supported. Data can be extracted from 
    the VegBank server in XML, and we will soon implement a set of convenient 
    alternative formats to facilitate use with common analytical tools.</span></p>
