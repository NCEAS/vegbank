  Plot and Project relationships</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1. A vegetation <a href="/dd/plot">plot</a> 
    is collected as part of a <a href="/dd/project">project</a>.</p>
  <p>2. A plot can contain 
    subplots defined by a recursive relationship</p>
  <p>3. A plot contains information 
    that will not change between temporally separated observations of a plot. 
    Transient information is stored in the Observation table. There must be at 
    least one observation for every plot, and multiple observations are possible.</p>
  <p>4. 
    Some plot attributes are constrained to fall within fixed lists. These include 
    USGS quadrangle, geographic area (e.g., country, state, county), soil type, 
    <a href="/dd/namedplace">named place</a> of 
    occurrence, and other identified in the <a href="@design_link@plotauxillary.html">list 
    of picklists</a>.</p>
