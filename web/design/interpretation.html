  Interpretation and taxon occurrence relationships.</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1. An <a href="/dd/observation">observation</a> 
    can be <a href="/dd/comminterpretation">interpreted</a>
 during one or more <a href="/dd/commclass">classification 
    events</a> as belonging to one or more particular types of vegetation. A vegetation 
    type corresponds to a &quot;community concept&quot; in the community taxonomy 
    module. Because vegetation can change, there is no necessary relationship 
    between the interpretations at different observation events for a plot.</p>
  <p>2. Each <a href="/dd/taxonobservation">plant 
    taxon observed</a> in an observation event is <a href="/dd/taxoninterpretation">interpreted</a> 
    by at least one <a href="/dd/party">party</a> 
    as belonging to a particular plant concept in the plant taxonomy module. Taxa 
    can be assigned various interpretations at various times by various parties. 
    </p>
  <p>3. A taxon observed during 
    an observation event might be observed 
    to occur in one or more <a href="/dd/stratum">strata</a>.  
    
    Various <a href="/dd/taxonimportance">importance values</a> may be associated with a particular stratum, or with the 
    
    taxon disregarding strata.</p>
  <p>4. One or more <a href="/dd/stemcount">woody 
    stems</a> of a taxon might be recorded by size as occurring during an observation 
    event.<br>
    </p>
  <p>5. A <a href="/dd/party">party</a> 
    contributes by interpreting a taxon as belonging to a taxon concept or an 
    observation as representing to a community concept. In each case a party might 
    contribute in various ways defined by <a href="@design_link@lists/aux_Role.html">rolecode</a>. 
    </p>
  <p>6. Some interpretations 
    are reported in <a href="/dd/reference">literature 
    which can be cited</a>.</p>
