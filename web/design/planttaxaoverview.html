        data models  </b></h2>
      <p>Classifications 
        of organisms and communities provide a complex set of problems that must 
        be addressed in any information system containing references to biological taxa or ecological communities. 
        The core problem is that taxonomic standards vary with time, place, and 
        investigator such that biological taxa and communities frequently have multiple 
        names and those same names frequently have been applied to multiple taxon 
        concepts. When we combine diverse 
        data into a single database, we need to reconcile those different standards.</p>
      <p>The 
        traditional solution has been to agree on a standard list and to map all 
        the various applications onto that list. For example, within the US we 
        have several standard lists of plant taxa including Kartesz (1999), <a
href="http://plants.usda.gov/">USDA PLANTS</a>, <a
href="http://www.itis.usda.gov/index.html">ITIS</a>, and <a
href="http://www.natureserveexplorer.org/">NatureServe Explorer</a>. However, 
        these lists fail to allow effective dataset integration for several reasons. 
        (1) Online lists are periodically updated but usually are not simultaneously 
        archived, with the consequence that the user cannot reconstruct the database 
        for some arbitrary time in the past. (2) Ambiguity arises from the fact 
        that one name can be used for multiple taxonomic concepts and one concept 
        can be labeled with multiple names. The standard lists do not define the 
        taxonomic concepts employed, or how they have changed as the list has 
        evolved. (3) Different parties have different perspectives on acceptable 
        names and the meanings associated with them</p>
      <p>Part 
        of the ambiguity arises from the requirement of biological nomenclature 
        that when a taxon is split, the name continues to be applied to the taxon 
        that includes the type specimen for the original name. Consider the case 
        of shagbark hickory, which some authors think of as a single entity and 
        others think should be divided into two: northern and southern shagbark. 
        If you encounter the name "<i>Carya ovata</i> (Miller) K. Koch" in a database, 
        you cannot be sure whether it means all shagbarks (<i>sec.</i> Gleason 
        1952), or just northern shagbark (<i>sec.</i> Radford et al. 1968). Trees 
        that Radford recognizes as <i>Carya carolinae-septentrionalis</i> would 
        be lumped within <i>Carya ovata</i> by a worker who follows Gleason. In 
        addition, authors differ as to whether they believe the two types of shagbark 
        should be recognized as distinct species or simply as varieties. Even 
        if you know a worker follows Strong's treatment of <i>Carya</i> in Flora 
        North America (1997), you cannot be sure whether plants identified as 
        <i>Carya ovata</i> include just <i>Carya ovata</i> var. <i>ovata</i>, 
        (= <i>C. ovata sec.</i> Radford et al.) or also includes <i>C. o</i>. 
        var <i>australis</i> (= <i>Carya carolinae-septentrionalis</i>). The adjacent 
        figure shows the three names (technically four with <i>C.o.</i> var <i>o.</i>) 
        associated with the shagbarks, the three references used above, and how 
        names and references combine to form three concepts. Note that there are 
        two alternative and synonymous name-reference pairs for each of the three 
        concepts. </p>

      couplet as an "assertion" (similar in meaning to "potential taxon" as used 
      by Berendsohn 1995). Several points emerge from this example. (1) A name-reference 
      combination constitutes an assertion of a taxonomic concept, though that 
      assertion may be synonymous with other assertions. (2) Identifications (e.g., 
      plot occurrences, specimen labels, treatments in authoritative works) should 
      be by reference to an assertion so as to allow identification of the taxonomic 
      concept intended. (3) A party might choose to recognize a certain set of 
      assertions as standard, and simultaneously recognize other assertions as 
      nonstandard. (4) Identification of the appropriate assertion to attach to 
      an organism does not immediately dictate which name should be applied to 
      that assertion.</p></td>

    <td height="264" colspan="2" valign="top"><p>We 
      designed a concept-based taxonomy data model and organized with ITIS and 
      the FGDC Biological Data Working Group <a href="http://biology.usgs.gov/fgdc.bio/FGDC_TaxNom.doc">a 
      meeting</a> to evaluate it. Our model centers on the <b><i>Assertion</i></b> 
      as the primary entity for labeling a community or an organism. This is represented 
      in the adjacent figure as an intersection of a <b><i>Name</i></b> and a 
      <b><i>Publication </i></b>wherein that name was used. An <b><i>Interpretation</i></b> 
      occurs when an organism or plot observation is labeled with an assertion. 
      As there can be many assertions that are synonyms or near synonyms, one 
      assertion needs to be chosen as having a <b><i>Status</i></b> of standard. 
      All nonstandard assertions should have specifiable <b><i>Correlations </i></b>with 
      one or more standard assertions. Similarly, an assertion often has a <b><i>Lineage 
      </i></b>such that predecessor and successor standard assertions are tracked. 
      A specific <b><i>Party</i></b> (e.g., ITIS, NatureServe, Flora North America) 
      can have its own views as to which assertions as standard, and thus will 
      have its own interpretations as to correlations. Although a name is a critical 
      component of the definition of an assertion, this is not necessarily the 
      name that a party would choose to apply to the assertion. A name <b><i>Usage</i></b> 
      is a party-specific application of a name to an assertion, which allows 
      names to change without necessarily changing the assertions tracked in the 
      database.</p></td>

      model we developed is similar to the data model proposed by the International 
      Organization for Plant Information (<a
href="http://iopi.csu.edu.au/iopi/">IOPI</a>; <a href="http://www.bgbm.org/biodivinf/docs/IOPI_Model/">Berendsohn 
      1997</a>). However, our model incorporates a number of advances over the 
      IOPI model. The core entity in the IOPI model is the "Potential taxon", 
      which represents a combination of our Assertion and Usage entities. Keeping 
      these separate clarifies the important difference between taxonomic concepts 
      and the names applied to those concepts, thereby creating greater stability 
      in the contents of derivative and linked databases. The IOPI model does 
      not explicitly recognize party perspectives, but instead maps preferred 
      views as deriving from publications. Because the IOPI model is organized 
      around fixed publication events, it does not efficiently map continually 
      changing party perspectives, making it difficult to provide software generated 
      time-specific party views of the database. </p></td>
