  Observation relationships</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1. An observation is 
    a one-time record of vegetation present in a <a href="/dd/plot">plot</a>.</p>
  <p>2. A plot must have at 
    least one observation and can have several observations, each of which references 
    the parent (earlier) observation via a recursive foreign key to that observation.</p>
  <p>3. Some plot attributes are constrained to fall within fixed lists. These are identified 
  in the list of <a href="@design_link@plotauxillary.html">picklists</a>.</p>
  <p>4. 
    Some attributes have multiple occurrences for an observation. There can be 
    multiple <a href="/dd/disturbanceobs">disturbances</a>, 
    <a href="/dd/soilobs">soil horizons</a>, and 
    <a href="/dd/graphic">graphic records</a>. 
    Multiple <a href="/dd/stratum">strata</a> 
    can be observed.<br>
    </p>
  <p>5. 
    Information on methodology can be specified by the observation attributes. 
  <a href="/dd/covermethod">Cover 
    method</a> and <a href="/dd/stratummethod">stratum 
    method</a> are two particularly important methods that need to be specified.</p>
  <p>6. 
    <a href="/dd/taxonobservation">Plant taxa 
    are observed</a> during observation events, as discussed in the <a href="@design_link@interpretation.html">interpretation</a> 
    section. </p>
  <p>7. 
    Observations can be <a href="/dd/commclass">assigned 
    to communities</a>, as discussed in the <a href="@design_link@interpretation.html">interpretation</a> 
    section.</p>
