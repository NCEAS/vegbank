<h3>VegBank Help -- Download Formats</h3>
 
 <ul><li><b>XML</b>- This download format is the native VegBank XML.  The entire VegBank database is 
 capable of being contained in this XML document.  Please see the <a href="@general_link@info.html">
 information page </a> for more information on our XML document. </li>
 <li><b>ASCII</b>- If you download data as flat-ASCII, you will get two documents. Each will be text, with
 field values separated by commas.  This is a standard format that you can easily import into a database or spreadsheet
 program, as well as analysis programs such as PC-Ord.  The first file will contain all plot-level data, and 
 the second file will contain data about species abundance.</li>
 <li><b>HTML</b>- HTML downloads allow you to save the view of plots that is available after querying.  The
 same can be accomplished (one plot at a time) by saving the HTML file that results when you view a plot.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Future download formats</h4>
 <p>We hope to allow users to download in the following formats in the near future:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>VegBranch</b>- This format will allow users to download plots and then import them into 
 <a href="@vegbranch_link@vegbranch.html">VegBranch</a>, VegBank's desktop client.  </li>
 <li><b>PC-Ord</b>- This format is similar to ASCII, but will be consistent with PC-Ord naming conventions.</li>
 <li><b>TurboVeg</b>- This download will be easily imported into TurboVeg, 
   a popular database system.</li>
   </ul>
