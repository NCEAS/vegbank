<h3>VegBank Concept Date</h3>
 <p>VegBank's plant concept and community concepts allow Party Perspectives to change over time.  You can specify
 a date on the query page to find out what a party's view of a plant or community was as of that date.  If you do not specify a date on the query,
 today's date is used and current Party Perspectives will be returned to you.</p>
