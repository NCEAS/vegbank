<h3>VegBank User Levels</h3>
 <p>We currently recognize four levels of VegBank users. </p>
        <p><b>Guest User.</b> Guest Users may query and download data, but are not permitted to 
        add data to VegBank.   Personalized views, preferences, stored queries and datasets are not possible as a Guest User.
        <p><b>Registered 
          User. </b>This status requires self registration. Registration is automatic 
          and requires only continued good behavior. Registered users may search 
          and download data, but may not upload plot data.  <br/>
          <span class="bright category">Coming soon:</span>Registered Users (and higher)
          may store personalized views, preferences, queries, and datasets to work with
          subsequently or share with other users </p>
        <p><b>Certified 
          User.</b> Certified Users are expected to demonstrate familiarity with 
          vegetation sampling methodology, plant identification, vegetation classification, 
          and the capabilities and applications of the VegBank archive. Certified users have 
          all the rights of registered users, may upload plot data, and may add annotations 
          and interpretations.</p>
        <p><b>Professional 
          User.</b> The status of Professional User connotes a high level of experience and 
          credibility. This status requires at least one year of experience as a Certified 
          User (or equivalent experience), and demonstrated proficiency with the four areas 
          of experience required of Certified Users.  </p>
