<h3>VegBank Help -- Searching by Text</h3>
 <p><a href="#examples">Examples</a> are below the explanation.</p>
 <p>
   There are many areas in VegBank where you can enter a term to search for in the database.
   
   You can use the following tips where "match ANY word" is an option,
     as well as in the search box in the header of every page:
   <ul>
      <li><span class="sizelarge">Case insensitive searches.</span><br/>   <code>ACER</code> is the same as <code>Acer</code> is the same as <code>acer</code> for the purposes of the search.</li>
      
      <li><span class="sizelarge">All words by default.</span><br/> Each word is searched for individually, and we assume that you would like 
        matches for ALL the words you provide.  If you want to search for any one of the words you enter,
        check the "Match any word" checkbox.
      </li>     
      
      <li><span class="sizelarge">Exact phrases.</span><br/>If you want to search for a phrase or compound word, enclose it in quotes, such as <code>"North Carolina"</code>
        or <code>"Acer rubrum"</code>.  Searches for <code>North Carolina</code> (without quotes) will match everything
        that has <code>North</code> associated with it somewhere and also <code>Carolina</code>.  So plots something in 
        North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina would be found by the <code>North Carolina</code> search, but not by the
        <code>"North Carolina"</code> search.
      </li>  
      
      <li>
        <span class="sizelarge">Whole words only.</span><br/>
        Check "Match whole words only" (if available) to search by entire words.  Otherwise, you may enter only parts
         of words.  If you search for <code>Carya</code> without "Match whole words only" checked, <code>Allocarya</code>
         will be found.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <span class="sizelarge">Negative searches.</span><br/>
         You can precede your search term with a negative sign (-) to
        search for something that <i>doesn't</i> include the following word.  You must still separate each
        term with a space.  If you search for <code>-acer carya</code> you'll find everything that has Carya, but not Acer.
        Note that you probably will want to leave "Match any word" unchecked if you are using a negative search.
      </li>
   </ul>
