<h3>VegBank Certification Explanation</h3>
<p>The 
          ESA Vegetation Panel will provide a certification program for VegBank 
          users. Certification is needed for at least two reasons.</p>
        <p>1. 
          The quality a user attaches to a plot observation in the archive is 
          likely to vary with his or her perception of the workers who collected 
          and submitted the data. In addition, users need a way to evaluate the 
          credentials of an individual who has contributed an annotation (note) 
          or interpretation (identification of a plot observation to community 
          type, or a plant observation to species/taxon). One function of certification 
          is to provide the user with a means of evaluating the ability of an 
          unknown worker.</p>
        <p>2. 
          The quality of a plot in the archive will increase as additional information 
          is added and interpretations are made. Not all users are qualified to 
          add information to plot records, nor will all users understand the database 
          and it uses well enough to know how best to add value to plot records. 
          Certain types of annotation or interpretation will require user certification.</p>
