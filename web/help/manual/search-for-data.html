<h2>VegBank Manual -- how to search for data</h2>

<p>VegBank contains many different kinds of vegetation plot data and offers several different search 
pages to find data of interest.  Each search page is generally called a "query" page,
because it queries the database for data, based on search criteria you provide on the page.
Below, the main search pages are listed.  Click a page to search for data.  There will be
more specific instructions on each search page.
</p>
<h4>Search Pages (Queries) in VegBank</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="@forms_url@plot-query.jsp">Plot Query</a> 
     - search for plots by location, species present, community type, 
  plot collectors, and other plot criteria.</li>
  <li><a href="@forms_url@plant-query.html">Plant Query</a>
     - search for plant concepts in VegBank, by name or some portion of a name.  
     <blockquote>
     A plant concept is more than simply a name of a plant.  It is defined by the combination of 
     a name and a reference.  This gives someone a framework for understanding what is meant by a plant name.
     For a more detailed explanation, see the <a href="@design_link@planttaxaoverview.html">overview</a> 
     of plant taxonomy as handled by VegBank. Note: assertions are the same thing as concepts in that article.</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="@forms_url@community-query.html">Community Query</a>
     - search for community concepts in VegBank, by name or some portion of a name. 
      <blockquote>
       A community concept is analogous to a plant concept.  Each community concept is
       defined by a combination of a name and a reference.  See the above explanation on plant
       taxonomy, as it applies directly to community concepts as well.
      </blockquote>
       
  </li>
  <li> <a href="@general_link@metadata.html">Supplemental Data</a> - at this time, searches of supplemental data are not possible,
     but you can view all supplemental data in VegBank.  This is supporting information,
     such as methods, people, and references.
     
  </li>
  
</ul>
