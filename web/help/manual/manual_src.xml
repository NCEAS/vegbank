    <manualItem finish="true" refURL="@plotquery_page_simple@" name="simple-plot-search" topic="Simple Plot Search">
      <manualHTML>The simple plot search will find plots based on one or more of the following: 
      <ul class="compactdots">
          <li>a state/province name or country in which the plot is found  <highlight id="tut_stateprovincecountry"/>
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
    Leave a field blank if you would like ignore one or more of these.  If you fill in more than one box, only plots that match <strong>ALL</strong> criteria will be found.   Case is ignored in this search (<code>Quercus</code> is the same as <code>querus</code>).  Use the percent (%) for a wildcard, meaning that you can write part of the name.  Tip: Queries are faster without wildcards.  Queries that start with a wildcard are slower than those that do not.  (<code>%alba</code> is slower than <code>Quercus%</code>, which is slower than <code>Quercus alba</code>.)<br/>
      Examples:
      <ul class="compactdots">
          <li>Search for plots in <code>Kansas</code>.</li>
          <li>Search for plots with plant name of <code>Acer rubrum</code>

          <li>Search for plots with a community name of <code>Quercus%Acer%</code>

      <manualHTML>
     This searches for plots by location, species present, community type, 
methodology, and other plot criteria.  A <a href="@plotquery_page_simple@">simpler search</a> is a good place to start if you're new to VegBank. VegBank will find the plots that match <strong>ALL the criteria</strong> on this form. <br/>
        <br/>
  To <strong>configure the search</strong> (optional), check the boxes by the fields you'd like to search in the "Configure Your Search" box <highlight id="tut_configurequery"/> and 
  press the "change query fields" button. Then, VegBank hides the list of fields to get them out of the way.  You can show them again to adjust which fields are shown (careful, this resets the form).  Scroll down past this box after configuration, or if you'd like to skip this step.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Fill in the query</strong> fields that you'd like to search by, using the MM/DD/YYYY format (like 01/15/2005) for dates and percent (%) for wildcard in text fields.  @Tut_StdSearchAdvice@   Press the search 
button at the bottom of the page to start your search. <br/>
If plants or communities are part of your search, there are <strong>several rows</strong> of entries for each.  You can use this to specify multiple plants that must be present or multiple community names that you want your plots to match.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Validation</strong>: If you enter dates or numbers that are in a format VegBank doesn't recognize, you'll get a popup message saying so.  The problem field will be highlighted. Please fix that entry and press "search" again.<br/>

        The Plot Search Results (the above link is an example) are displayed any time you search for plots (from the map, the list of plots for a particular plant, project, method, etc.).  If you used the <a href="advanced-plot-search">Advanced Plot Search</a>, then these results will be configured according the the fields shown there.  Otherwise, the default set of fields will appear. <br/>
      <br/>
Most of the time, a message <highlight id="tut_plotcriteriamessages"/> will appear at the top of the screen, identifying what search criteria were used to find the plots listed below.  If no message appears, you probably clicked a simple link from a project, plant, etc. to see the plots that are connected to it.  <br/>
      <br/>
 The headers on the first row sometimes show more than one field that will appear below.  If so, the headers are separated by a horizontal line.  Each plot is represented by one shaded row under the headers.   This is only a short summary of the plot, click the <a href="view-plot-details">"plot detail"</a> link on a row to see the full details of a plot. Only some plants are listed in this view.  <strong>There are many links</strong> to more detail throughout this and all views of VegBank data.<br/>
      <br/>
You can add plots to your datacart, which allows you to collect plots from different query results.  You can also download plots in your <a href="datacart-building">datacart</a>. <br/>

  Link to an example plot detail page with the <a href="@get_link@comprehensive/observation/VB.Ob.3801.GRSM261">this link</a>.  This view shows almost all of the information about a plot in VegBank.  There are many fields, and you can show or hide field information <highlight id="tut_showhidefieldinfo"/> to show links to the 
<a href="data-dictionary">data dictionary</a> which describes each field in detail.  You can also hover over a field name with your cursor and some information is displayed as a tool tip. <br/>

The information about the whole plot is listed on the left <highlight id="tut_plotdetailleft"/>, and the plants found on this plot are listed on the right. <highlight id="tut_plotdetailplants"/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
There are <strong> three different options</strong> for viewing plants: by strata, overall cover, and both.  Some plots have species listed only by stratum, some have only listings by overall cover.  Some have both.  VegBank shows strata by default if strata exist for a plot.  If you show both stratum records and overall cover, the overall cover records will have <code>-all-</code> listed as their stratum.  Click a plant name to see more information about it, and/or to interpret the species to a plant concept.
<br/>
        <br/> The plant view can be <strong>sorted</strong> by clicking a green header row.  The initial sort order can be recreated by clicking the first "ord" column.  The intial order attempts to list the tallest stratum first, then by decreasing cover values within each stratum. <br/>

Here, you can navigate throughout the hierarchy (to parents and children) with the parent and children links.  Different people and organizations have different opinions about which plants should be grouped under which, thus the hierarchy is party-dependent.

      This page shows details of one or more community concepts.  
  Sometimes, a message <highlight id="tut_commcriteriamessage"/> will appear telling you what you searched for. <br/>
        <br/>

Each area between beige banners <highlight id="tut_fullcomm"/> represent one community concept.    The area in white <highlight id="tut_communiversal"/> represents static information about the community, which is independent of party.  The <strong>Concept definition</strong> is the name combined with the reference in which the name is described.  These are listed here, as is a <strong>link to plots</strong> which have been interpreted as this community.
<br/>
        <br/>
  The area in grey <highlight id="tut_commpartyperspective"/> represents information that is part of one <strong>party perspective</strong>, that is someone's opinion about a community (whether or not it is accepted, where in the hierarchy it fits, names to call it, and synonyms).  Here, you can navigate throughout the hierarchy (to parents and children) with the parent and children links.  Different people and organizations have different opinions about which communities should be grouped under which, thus the hierarchy is party-dependent.  You can also link to synonyms and the <strong>NatureServe Explorer</strong> website for communities originating there.
<br/>
        <br/>
Please note that it is possible for more than one party perspective to be listed per community.

<br/>
      <br/>
VegBank views are generally of two types: summary and detail.  Summary views <a href="@get_link@summary/covermethod">example cover method summary</a> are generally one table with a header row.  Detail views offer more information and so each element takes up more rows <a href="@get_link@detail/covermethod">example cover method details</a>.

VegBank views are tightly interconnected, with links to related data scattered throughout each view.  Please use the back button on your browser after clicking some links if you'd like to get back to your original search results.  <br/>
      <br/>
Currently, only plots can be added to the <a href="datacart-building">datacart</a>.  We plan to add the capacity to add other items to the datacart soon, allowing you to search by groups of data in the datacart and to <strong>download</strong> supplemental data, as well. <br/>

      <manualHTML>
        The General Search works differently from other searches in VegBank.  Other searches require you to search <strong>specific fields</strong> in order to find <strong>a certain kind of data</strong>, like plots, plants, or communities.  The General Search is much less specific.  
<br/>
        <br/>
The General Search looks for keyword(s) in <strong>lots of fields</strong> and <strong>all kinds of data</strong>.  This is a very wide funnel, but is a good starting point to find data.
There are three places to start a general search: 
<ul class="compactdots">
          <li>The Header <highlight id="header-left"/>
          </li>
          <li>The <a href="@forms_link@metasearch.jsp">General Search Page</a>
          </li>
          <li>The <a href="firefox-toolbar">Firefox Search Plugin</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
Enter a word or words (or even part of a word) into the search box and press the search button ("go" button on the header).  VegBank will search all kinds of data<sup>1</sup> for all<sup>2</sup> the words you specified.  <br/>
        <br/>  All keywords for related data are included in the search.  So, a plant name or place name will be part of the keywords for a plot. <br/>
        <br/>
 To search more specifically, please use <a href="@plotquery_page_advanced@">the advanced plot search</a>, <a href="@forms_link@PlantQuery.jsp">the plant search</a>, or the <a href="@forms_link@CommQuery.jsp">the community search</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
This is currently the only way to search <a href="supplemental-data">Supplemental Data</a>.
<br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>1</sup>
        <span class="psmall">You can restrict the General Search in the header, by specifying what kind of data you're looking for, for example, plots or people.  Select "anything" to remove search restrictions. <br/>
        </span>
        <sup>2</sup>
        <span class="psmall">You can check the "match any word" checkbox in the main General Search page to search for items containing any word (separated by spaces) in the search box.

Zooming out (~ 75%) is recommended for getting an overall picture of how all the tables relate; zooming in (120% +) is recommended for understanding how a smaller section of the database works.  <br/>

  <manualItem finish="true" refURL="@general_link@cite.html" name="how-to-cite-vegbank" topic="How to Cite VegBank">
    <manualHTML>
        VegBank is an archival vegetation ecology database.  Several different kinds of data may be cited: observation, party, reference, plantConcept, and commConcept.  Each of these has an <b>Accession Code</b> in VegBank , which uniquely identifies it.  This Accession Code may be used by you to cite VegBank and make reference to the particular data here.<br/>
      <br/>
The <a href="@general_link@cite.html">How to Cite Page</a> describes how you can use these Accession Codes to cite data.


<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Understanding Accession Codes (advanced):</strong>
      <br/> An example Accession codes for a plot-observation: <code>VB.Ob.3801.GRSM261</code>.  Each code is broken into several pieces, split by periods (.).  
<ul class="compactdots">
        <li>
          <code>VB</code> represents the database which contains the data.  Here, VB stands for VegBank.  In the future there may be multiple VegBank databases, each of which may maintain  different data. </li>
        <li>
          <code>Ob</code> represents the table the data came from, using 2 letter codes (<code>Ob</code> stands for observation).  Plots are best cited using an Observation Accession Code, because observations are the sampling of a plot at a time, which is generally what people want to cite.</li>
        <li>
          <code>3801</code> is the record number for the table (observation) in the database (VegBank).</li>
        <li>
          <code>GRSM261</code> is the <strong>confirmation value</strong>, which is not necessary for uniqueness, because the first three values will uniquely identify each element. But this value serves two other purposes.  <br/>
          <strong>First,</strong> it helps protect against typos.  Without this value, typos such as <code>VB.Ob.3810</code> would go undetected and users would see a plot other than the one they expected. With confirmation values, the typo code would be: <code>VB.Ob.3810.GRSM261</code>, which VegBank could not find, because it doesn't exist.  Then, you could try to piece back what happened and perhaps get the correct plot after all.  This may not always work, as plots could share the same confirmation code, but the confirmation value helps prevent this.  <br/>
          <strong>Second,</strong> it may provide a humanly readable handle which helps you to know what it is you're looking at.  For observations, the authorObsCode is used as the confirmation value.  Other tables use various fields which are somewhat unique.  </li>
        <li>In the future, Accession Codes used for citations will also include a date-time (GMT) after the first 4, such as <code>2003-04-18T14:43:27</code>.  This will be used to recreate the cited item as looked at that point in time.</li>

      VegBank differs from many online databases in that <strong>our data comes from users</strong>
      who decide to share their plot data through VegBank.  A brief <a href="request-certification">certification</a> form must be filled out
to request certification, which is necessary before you contribute data.  This helps
ensure that the data you can view here comes from ecologists who both understand VegBank

the user must own the plot data or have permission to share this data online.  
Currently, plots may be only be submitted in our <a href="vegbank-xml">VegBank XML</a> format.  
Generally, this will be generated by a program based on a database.  We <strong>strongly recommend <a href="vegbranch">VegBranch</a>
        </strong>
as the means for creating the XML file which will hold your data.  Once you have generated the XML file, click the <a href="@DisplayUploadPlotAction@">Submit Data</a> link on the header to load this into VegBank.  <br/><br/>On that page, enter the file name (or browse for it) on your computer of the XML file (or in public web space) and press the continue button.

This is called annotation.  There are a few ways to annotate data in VegBank:

          <p>Once a user has viewed  an observation in VegBank, he or she may decide that it
belongs to a certain community type.  Each observation may be interpreted multiple times as
belonging to different community types.  Each party may have its own opinion to which community an observation
belongs.  Parties may also assign the observation to more than one community
as part of the same interpretation.  Each assignment may have its own fit and confidence,
which are the party's self-assessment of how well the observation matches the community, and how
sure the party is that such a fit is indeed accurate.

Each plot has at least one taxon observation, which is the plot author's record of a plant that
occurs on the plot.  The author records his or her name that was used for this plant, as well
as the reference that s/he used to determine this name.  Each plant on each plot has at least one, and perhaps many,
interpretations as to which plant concept it really is.  If a VegBank user has some knowledge
of the plot, or perhaps the area, and believes that s/he can interpret what this plant is, differently from
the interpretations already made, s/he may add a new taxon interpretation.  Reasons for doing so could be that
taxonomy has changed and the author's taxon has been split.  The VegBank user may have some knowledge of the 
observation or the general area and believe they know what the new taxon should be.  Also, cases exist where
the plot author was uncertain of what the plant was.  Subsequent users may interpret the taxon, perhaps based 
on a voucher, to clarify what the taxon is likely to be.  Each assignment may have its own fit and confidence,
which are the party's self-assessment of how well the plant on the plot matches the plant concept, and how
sure the party is that such a fit is indeed accurate.
</p>
          <p>Interpret a taxon by: <a href="@plotquery_page_advanced@">Searching for plots</a>, then clicking a plant name on a plot.  In this detailed view <a href="@get_link@std/taxonobservation/VB.TO.88719.ACERRUBRUML">(an example)</a>

"This is the only known occurrence of this species in our province, to date."<br/>
"The plot author indicates that fires may have affected this plot in the last 50 years.  Park records show that
there fires in this national park were 42 years before this plot-observation."

The 
          ESA Vegetation Panel will provide a certification program for VegBank 
          users. Certification is needed for at least two reasons. <br/>
1. 
          The quality a user attaches to a plot observation in the archive is 
          likely to vary with his or her perception of the workers who collected 
          and submitted the data. In addition, users need a way to evaluate the 
          credentials of an individual who has contributed an annotation (note) 
          or interpretation (identification of a plot observation to community 
          type, or a plant observation to species/taxon). One function of certification 
          is to provide the user with a means of evaluating the ability of an 
          unknown worker.<br/>
2. 
          The quality of a plot in the archive will increase as additional information 
          is added and interpretations are made. Not all users are qualified to 
          add information to plot records, nor will all users understand the database 
          and it uses well enough to know how best to add value to plot records. 
          Certain types of annotation or interpretation will require user certification. <br/>
