    <manualItem finish="true" refURL="@plotquery_page_simple@" name="simple-plot-search" topic="Simple Plot Search">
      <manualHTML>The simple plot search will find plots based on one or more of the following: 
      <ul class="compactdots">
          <li>a state/province name or country in which the plot is found  <highlight id="tut_stateprovincecountry"/>
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
    Leave a field blank if you would like ignore one or more of these.  If you fill in more than one box, only plots that match <strong>ALL</strong> criteria will be found.   Case is ignored in this search (<code>Quercus</code> is the same as <code>querus</code>).  Use the percent (%) for a wildcard, meaning that you can write part of the name.  Tip: Queries are faster without wildcards.  Queries that start with a wildcard are slower than those that do not.  (<code>%alba</code> is slower than <code>Quercus%</code>, which is slower than <code>Quercus alba</code>.)<br/>
      Examples:
      <ul class="compactdots">
          <li>Search for plots in <code>Kansas</code>.</li>
          <li>Search for plots with plant name of <code>Acer rubrum</code>

          <li>Search for plots with a community name of <code>Quercus%Acer%</code>

      <manualHTML>
     This searches for plots by location, species present, community type, 
methodology, and other plot criteria.  A <a href="@plotquery_page_simple@">simpler search</a> is a good place to start if you're new to VegBank. VegBank will find the plots that match <strong>ALL the criteria</strong> on this form. <br/>
        <br/>
  To <strong>configure the search</strong> (optional), check the boxes by the fields you'd like to search in the "Configure Your Search" box <highlight id="tut_configurequery"/> and 
  press the "change query fields" button. Then, VegBank hides the list of fields to get them out of the way.  You can show them again to adjust which fields are shown (careful, this resets the form).  Scroll down past this box after configuration, or if you'd like to skip this step.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Fill in the query</strong> fields that you'd like to search by, using the MM/DD/YYYY format (like 01/15/2005) for dates and percent (%) for wildcard in text fields.  @Tut_StdSearchAdvice@   Press the search 
button at the bottom of the page to start your search. <br/>
If plants or communities are part of your search, there are <strong>several rows</strong> of entries for each.  You can use this to specify multiple plants that must be present or multiple community names that you want your plots to match.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Validation</strong>: If you enter dates or numbers that are in a format VegBank doesn't recognize, you'll get a popup message saying so.  The problem field will be highlighted. Please fix that entry and press "search" again.<br/>

        The Plot Search Results (the above link is an example) are displayed any time you search for plots (from the map, the list of plots for a particular plant, project, method, etc.).  If you used the <a href="advanced-plot-search">Advanced Plot Search</a>, then these results will be configured according the the fields shown there.  Otherwise, the default set of fields will appear. <br/>
      <br/>
Most of the time, a message <highlight id="tut_plotcriteriamessages"/> will appear at the top of the screen, identifying what search criteria were used to find the plots listed below.  If no message appears, you probably clicked a simple link from a project, plant, etc. to see the plots that are connected to it.  <br/>
      <br/>
 The headers on the first row sometimes show more than one field that will appear below.  If so, the headers are separated by a horizontal line.  Each plot is represented by one shaded row under the headers.   This is only a short summary of the plot, click the <a href="view-plot-details">"plot detail"</a> link on a row to see the full details of a plot. Only some plants are listed in this view.  <strong>There are many links</strong> to more detail throughout this and all views of VegBank data.<br/>
      <br/>
You can add plots to your datacart, which allows you to collect plots from different query results.  You can also download plots in your <a href="datacart-building">datacart</a>. <br/>

  Link to an example plot detail page with the <a href="@get_link@comprehensive/observation/VB.Ob.3801.GRSM261">this link</a>.  This view shows almost all of the information about a plot in VegBank.  There are many fields, and you can show or hide field information <highlight id="tut_showhidefieldinfo"/> to show links to the 
<a href="data-dictionary">data dictionary</a> which describes each field in detail.  You can also hover over a field name with your cursor and some information is displayed as a tool tip. <br/>

The information about the whole plot is listed on the left <highlight id="tut_plotdetailleft"/>, and the plants found on this plot are listed on the right. <highlight id="tut_plotdetailplants"/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
There are <strong> three different options</strong> for viewing plants: by strata, overall cover, and both.  Some plots have species listed only by stratum, some have only listings by overall cover.  Some have both.  VegBank shows strata by default if strata exist for a plot.  If you show both stratum records and overall cover, the overall cover records will have <code>-all-</code> listed as their stratum.  Click a plant name to see more information about it, and/or to interpret the species to a plant concept.
<br/>
        <br/> The plant view can be <strong>sorted</strong> by clicking a green header row.  The initial sort order can be recreated by clicking the first "ord" column.  The intial order attempts to list the tallest stratum first, then by decreasing cover values within each stratum. <br/>

  Sometimes, a message <highlight id="tut_commcriteriamessage"/> will appear telling you what you searched for. <br/>
        <br/>

Each area between beige banners <highlight id="tut_fullcomm"/> represent one community concept.    The area in white <highlight id="tut_communiversal"/> represents static information about the community, which is independent of party.  The <strong>Concept definition</strong> is the name combined with the reference in which the name is described.  These are listed here, as is a <strong>link to plots</strong> which have been interpreted as this community.
<br/>
        <br/>
  The area in grey <highlight id="tut_commpartyperspective"/> represents information that is part of one <strong>party perspective</strong>, that is someone's opinion about a community (whether or not it is accepted, where in the hierarchy it fits, names to call it, and synonyms).  Here, you can navigate throughout the hierarchy (to parents and children) with the parent and children links.  Different people and organizations have different opinions about which communities should be grouped under which, thus the hierarchy is party-dependent.  You can also link to synonyms and the <strong>NatureServe Explorer</strong> website for communities originating there.
<br/>
        <br/>
Please note that it is possible for more than one party perspective to be listed per community.

VegBank views are generally of two types: summary and detail.  Summary views <a href="@get_link@summary/covermethod">example cover method summary</a> are generally one table with a header row.

      <manualHTML>
        The General Search works differently from other searches in VegBank.  Other searches require you to search <strong>specific fields</strong> in order to find <strong>a certain kind of data</strong>, like plots, plants, or communities.  The General Search is much less specific.  
<br/>
        <br/>
The General Search looks for keyword(s) in <strong>lots of fields</strong> and <strong>all kinds of data</strong>.  This is a very wide funnel, but is a good starting point to find data.
There are three places to start a general search: 
<ul class="compactdots">
          <li>The Header <highlight id="header-left"/>
          </li>
          <li>The <a href="@forms_link@metasearch.jsp">General Search Page</a>

          <li>The <a href="firefox-toolbar">Firefox Search Plugin</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
<strong>Case is ignored.</strong>  Enter a word or words (or even part of a word<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>) into the search box and press the search button ("go" button on the header).  VegBank will search all kinds of data<sup><a href="#note1">2</a></sup> for all<sup><a href="#note1">3</a></sup> the words you specified.  This search works like most search engines.  Enclose a phrase in quotes to look that phrase, i.e. <code>"North Carolina" Acer</code> could be used to look for plots in North Carolina with Acer mentioned.  Note that <code>North Carolina Acer</code> would find plots in South <i>Carolina</i> that are in <i>North</i> Myrtle Beach, and have Acer mentioned.<br/>
        <br/>  All keywords for related data are included in the search.  So, a plant name or place name will be part of the keywords for a plot. <br/>
        <br/>
 To search more specifically, please use <a href="@plotquery_page_advanced@">the advanced plot search</a>, <a href="@forms_link@PlantQuery.jsp">the plant search</a>, or the <a href="@forms_link@CommQuery.jsp">the community search</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
This is currently the only way to search <a href="supplemental-data">Supplemental Data</a>.
<br/>
        <br/>
        <a name="note1"></a><sup>1</sup><span class="psmall">By default, searches will match parts of words.  If this becomes problematic, such as when <code>Acerates</code> is being found when you search for <code>Acer</code>, you can check the "Match Whole Words" check box on the General Search Page.</span>

  <manualItem finish="true" refURL="@general_link@cite.html" name="how-to-cite-vegbank" topic="How to Cite VegBank">
    <manualHTML>
        VegBank is an archival vegetation ecology database.  Several different kinds of data may be cited: observation, party, reference, plantConcept, and commConcept.  Each of these has an <b>Accession Code</b> in VegBank , which uniquely identifies it.  This Accession Code may be used by you to cite VegBank and make reference to the particular data here.<br/>
      <br/>
The <a href="@general_link@cite.html">How to Cite Page</a> describes how you can use these Accession Codes to cite data.


<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Understanding Accession Codes (advanced):</strong>
      <br/> An example Accession codes for a plot-observation: <code>VB.Ob.3801.GRSM261</code>.  Each code is broken into several pieces, split by periods (.).  
<ul class="compactdots">
        <li>
          <code>VB</code> represents the database which contains the data.  Here, VB stands for VegBank.  In the future there may be multiple VegBank databases, each of which may maintain  different data. </li>
        <li>
          <code>Ob</code> represents the table the data came from, using 2 letter codes (<code>Ob</code> stands for observation).  Plots are best cited using an Observation Accession Code, because observations are the sampling of a plot at a time, which is generally what people want to cite.</li>
        <li>
          <code>3801</code> is the record number for the table (observation) in the database (VegBank).</li>
        <li>
          <code>GRSM261</code> is the <strong>confirmation value</strong>, which is not necessary for uniqueness, because the first three values will uniquely identify each element. But this value serves two other purposes.  <br/>
          <strong>First,</strong> it helps protect against typos.  Without this value, typos such as <code>VB.Ob.3810</code> would go undetected and users would see a plot other than the one they expected. With confirmation values, the typo code would be: <code>VB.Ob.3810.GRSM261</code>, which VegBank could not find, because it doesn't exist.  Then, you could try to piece back what happened and perhaps get the correct plot after all.  This may not always work, as plots could share the same confirmation code, but the confirmation value helps prevent this.  <br/>
          <strong>Second,</strong> it may provide a humanly readable handle which helps you to know what it is you're looking at.  For observations, the authorObsCode is used as the confirmation value.  Other tables use various fields which are somewhat unique.  </li>
        <li>In the future, Accession Codes used for citations will also include a date-time (GMT) after the first 4, such as <code>2003-04-18T14:43:27</code>.  This will be used to recreate the cited item as looked at that point in time.</li>

Currently, plots may be only be submitted in our <a href="vegbank-xml">VegBank XML</a> format.  
Generally, this will be generated by a program based on a database.  We <strong>strongly recommend <a href="vegbranch">VegBranch</a>

as the means for creating the XML file which will hold your data.  Once you have generated the XML file, click the <a href="@DisplayUploadPlotAction@">Submit Data</a> link on the header to load this into VegBank.  <br/>
        <br/>On that page, enter the file name (or browse for it) on your computer of the XML file (or in public web space) and press the continue button.  You'll receive an email receipt notifying you whether or not your plots loaded successfully, and if so, a link to see them online in VegBank.

        <p>Interpret a taxon by: <a href="@plotquery_page_advanced@">Searching for plots</a>, then clicking a plant name on a plot.  In this detailed view <a href="@get_link@std/taxonobservation/VB.TO.88719.ACERRUBRUML">[example]</a>
          of a plant on a plot, there will be an "Interpret this Plant" link which will take you to the interpretation form.</p>
        <p>The interpretation form consists of only very few fields, most of which are self-explanatory.  You must find the <strong>Accession Code</strong>
          of the plant concept that you believe represents the taxon on the plot.  There is a link to a pop-up query to help you find that concept.  Once
          you have found the accession code, copy and paste it into the "plant concept acccession code" box.</p>
        <p>
          The other fields relate to <strong>your interpretation, not the author's</strong>.  Fit is how well the concept fits the taxon on the plot.  If your taxon is large (genus or family), then fit is less likely to be high (unless the taxon on the plot included a lot of the genus, i.e. multiple species).  Confidence is how sure you are about what you've done.  This is NOT FIT.  If you are certain that the fit is poor, your confidence should be high.  Please fill in some notes as to why you interpreted the plant the way you did.

So, with this, you can type in words and press enter, and very quickly find data in VegBank.

    If you register with VegBank, you can have your own account, which lets you customize your experience at VegBank.org, similar to many other websites.
    Links to Your Account features can be found on the header <highlight id="header-right"/>.  In your account, you can see
    the plots you've submitted, the options you've specified, and can link to forms for loggin in and out, registering, and certification.
    See the next few topics for details.

      <manualHTML>
    We suggest that users <a href="@forms_link@RegisterNewUser.jsp">register</a>
  so that we can 
(1) track use of VegBank data, 
(2) maintain user profiles with preferences and use history, 
and (3) establish appropriate levels of certification and permissions for advanced functions.  
If you choose not to register, you may still use the site as a guest, but you will not be able to access certain functions (namely, anything that adds data to the database or adds any annotations).
<br/>
        <br/>
You will sign onto VegBank using your email account and a password of your choosing.  If your email account has already been registered, simply use the "forgot password" link and the password will be emailed to you.  You will be prompted to login if you attempt to access a page in VegBank that requires registration or certification.

 To become a Vegbank user, you must read and agree to the <a href="@general_link@terms.html">VegBank

You may <a href="@web_context@LoadUser.do">change information</a> about your personal user account.  There is a link from that page to change your account password, too.  If you forget your password, it can be emailed to you (see the next topic).  Please keep your email address updated, as this will enable us to email you a password, if lost.  We also hope to add features which allow you to receive email updates when data of interest are added to VegBank, or users annotate the data you submitted.  Please see our <a href="@general_link@privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to assure you that we will not share this information, except for any information you provide during a <a href="/vegbank/LoadCertification.do">certification-request</a> which was noted public on that form.

      <manualHTML>
The 
          ESA Vegetation Panel will provide a certification program for VegBank 
          users. Certification is needed for at least two reasons. <br/>
1. 
          The quality a user attaches to a plot observation in the archive is 
          likely to vary with his or her perception of the workers who collected 
          and submitted the data. In addition, users need a way to evaluate the 
          credentials of an individual who has contributed an annotation (note) 
          or interpretation (identification of a plot observation to community 
          type, or a plant observation to species/taxon). One function of certification 
          is to provide the user with a means of evaluating the ability of an 
          unknown worker.<br/>
2. 
          The quality of a plot in the archive will increase as additional information 
          is added and interpretations are made. Not all users are qualified to 
          add information to plot records, nor will all users understand the database 
          and it uses well enough to know how best to add value to plot records. 
          Certain types of annotation or interpretation will require user certification. <br/>
